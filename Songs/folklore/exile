I
can
see
you
standing,
honey
With
his
arms
around
your
body
Laughin',
but
the
joke's
not
funny
at
all
And
it
took
you
five
whole
minutes
To
pack
us
up
and
leave
me
with
it
Holdin'
all
this
love
out
here
in
the
hall
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
And
I
did
not
like
the
ending
You're
not
my
homeland
anymore
So
what
am
I
defending
now?
You
were
my
town,
now
I
am
in
exile,
seein'
you
out
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
Ooh,
ooh,
ooh
I
can
see
you
starin',
honey
Like
he
is
just
your
understudy
Like
you
would
get
your
knuckles
bloody
for
me
Second,
third,
and
hundredth
chances
Balancin'
on
breaking
branches
Those
eyes
add
insult
to
injury
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
And
I
did
not
like
the
ending
I
am
not
your
problem
anymore
So
who
am
I
offending
now?
You
were
my
crown,
now
I
am
in
exile,
seein'
you
out
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
So
I
am
leaving
out
the
side
door
So
step
right
out,
there
is
no
amount
Of
crying
I
can
do
for
you
All
this
time
We
always
walked
a
very
thin
line
You
did
not
even
hear
me
out
(You
did
not
even
hear
me
out)
You
never
gave
a
warning
sign
(I
gave
so
many
signs)
All
this
time
I
never
learned
to
read
your
mind
(Never
learned
to
read
my
mind)
I
could
not
turn
things
around
(You
never
turned
things
around)
'Cause
you
never
gave
a
warning
sign
(I
gave
so
many
signs)
So
many
signs,
so
many
signs
You
did
not
even
see
the
signs
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
And
I
did
not
like
the
ending
You're
not
my
homeland
anymore
So
what
am
I
defending
now?
You
were
my
town,
now
I
am
in
exile,
seein'
you
out
I
think
I
have
seen
this
film
before
So
I
am
leavin'
out
the
side
door
So
step
right
out,
there
is
no
amount
Of
crying
I
can
do
for
you
All
this
time
We

Ah,
