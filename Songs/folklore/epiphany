Keep
your
helmet,
keep
your
life,
son
Just
a
flesh
wound,
here
is
your
rifle
Crawling
up
the
beaches
now
"Sir,
I
think
he
is
bleeding
out"
And
some
things
you
just
cannot
speak
about
With
you
I
serve,
with
you
I
fall
down,
down
Watch
you
breathe
in,
watch
you
breathing
out,
out
Something
med
school
did
not
cover
Someone's
daughter,
someone
is
mother
Holds
your
hand
through
plastic
now
"Doc,
I
think
she
is
crashing
out"
And
some
things
you
just
cannot
speak
about
Only
twenty
minutes
to
sleep
But
you
dream
of
some
epiphany
Just
one
single
glimpse
of
relief
To
make
some
sense
of
what
you
have
seen
With
you
I
serve,
with
you
I
fall
down,
down
(Down)
Watch
you
breathe
in,
watch
you
breathing
out,
out
With
you
I
serve
(With
you
I
serve),
with
you
I
fall
down
(Down),
down
(Down)
Watch
you
breathe
in
(Watch
you
breathe
in),
watch
you
breathing
out
(Out),
out
(Out)
Only
twenty
minutes
to
sleep
But
you
dream
of
some
epiphany
Just
one
single
glimpse
of
relief
To
make
some
sense
of
what
you
have
seen
