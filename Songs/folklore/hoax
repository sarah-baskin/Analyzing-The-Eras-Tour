my
only
one
my
smoking
gun
my
eclipsed
sun
this
has
broken
me
down
my
twisted
knife
my
sleepless
night
my
winless
fight
this
has
frozen
my
ground
stood
on
the
cliffside
screaming
,
``
give
me
a
reason
''
your
faithless
love
's
the
only
hoax
i
believe
in
do
n't
want
no
other
shade
of
blue
but
you
no
other
sadness
in
the
world
would
do
my
best
laid
plan
your
sleight
of
hand
my
barren
land
i
am
ash
from
your
fire
stood
on
the
cliffside
screaming
,
``
give
me
a
reason
''
your
faithless
love
's
the
only
hoax
i
believe
in
do
n't
want
no
other
shade
of
blue
but
you
no
other
sadness
in
the
world
would
do

part
of
me

the
point
of
keeping
