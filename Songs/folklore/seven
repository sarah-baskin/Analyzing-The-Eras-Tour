Please
picture
me
in
the
trees
I
hit
my
peak
at
seven
Feet
in
the
swing
over
the
creek
I
was
too
scared
to
jump
in
But
I,
I
was
high
in
the
sky
With
Pennsylvania
under
me
Are
there
still
beautiful
things?
Sweet
tea
in
the
summer
Cross
your
heart,
will
not
tell
no
other
And
though
I
cannot
recall
your
face
I
still
got
love
for
you
Your
braids
like
a
pattern
Love
you
to
the
Moon
and
to
Saturn
Passed
down
like
folk
songs
The
love
lasts
so
long
And
I
have
been
meaning
to
tell
you
I
think
your
house
is
haunted
Your
dad
is
always
mad
and
that
must
be
why
And
I
think
you
should
come
live
with
me
And
we
can
be
pirates
Then
you
will
not
have
to
cry
Or
hide
in
the
closet
And
just
like
a
folk
song
Our
love
will
be
passed
on
Please
picture
me
in
the
weeds
Before
I
learned
civility
I
used
to
scream
ferociously
Any
time
I
wanted
I,
I
Sweet
tea
in
the
summer
Cross
my
heart,
will
not
tell
no
other
And
though
I
cannot
recall
your
face
I
still
got
love
for
you
Pack
your
dolls
and
a
sweater
We'll
move
to
India
forever
Passed
down
like
folk
songs
Our
love
lasts
so
long
