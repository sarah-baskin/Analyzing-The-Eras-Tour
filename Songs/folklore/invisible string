green
was
the
color
of
the
grass
where
i
used
to
read
at
centennial
park
i
used
to
think
i
would
meet
somebody
there
teal
was
the
color
of
your
shirt
when
you
were
sixteen
at
the
yogurt
shop
you
used
to
work
at
to
make
a
little
money
time
,
curious
time
gave
me
no
compasses
,
gave
me
no
signs
were
there
clues
i
did
n't
see
?
and
is
n't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
all
along
there
was
some
invisible
string
tying
you
to
me
?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
bad
was
the
blood
of
the
song
in
the
cab
on
your
first
trip
to
la
you
ate
at
my
favorite
spot
for
dinner
bold
was
the
waitress
on
our
three-year
trip
getting
lunch
down
by
the
lakes
she
said
i
looked
like
an
american
singer
time
,
mystical
time
cutting
me
open
,
then
healing
me
fine
were
there
clues
i
did
n't
see
?
and
is
n't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
all
along
there
was
some
invisible
string
tying
you
to
me
?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
a
string
that
pulled
me
out
of
all
the
wrong
arms
,
right
into
that
dive
bar
something
wrapped
all
of
my
past
mistakes
in
barbed
wire
chains
around
my
demons
wool
to
brave
the
seasons
one
single
thread
of
gold
tied
me
to
you
cold
was
the
steel
of
my
axe
to
grind
for
the
boys
who
broke
my
heart
now
i
send
their
babies
presents
gold
was
the
color
of
the
leaves
when
i
showed
you
around
centennial
park
hell
was
the
journey
,
but
it
brought
me
heaven
time
,
wondrous
time
gave
me
the
blues
and
then
purple-pink
skies
and
it
's
cool
,
baby
,
with
me
and
is
n't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
all
along
there
was
some
invisible
string
tying
you
to
me
?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
me
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(
ah-ah-ah
)
(
ah-ah-ah
)
