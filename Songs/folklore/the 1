I
am
doing
good,
I
am
on
some
new
shit
Been
saying
"yes"
instead
of
"no"
I
thought
I
saw
you
at
the
bus
stop,
I
did
not
though
I
hit
the
ground
running
each
night
I
hit
the
Sunday
matinée
You
know
the
greatest
films
of
all
time
were
never
made
I
guess
you
never
know,
never
know
And
if
you
wanted
me,
you
really
should
have
showed
And
if
you
never
bleed,
you
are
never
going
to
grow
And
it
is
alright
now
But
we
were
something,
do
not
you
think
so?
Roaring
twenties,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
And
if
my
wishes
came
true
It
would
have
been
you
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
But
it
would
have
been
fun
If
you
would
have
been
the
one
(Ooh)
I
have
this
dream
you
are
doing
cool
shit
Having
adventures
on
your
own
You
meet
some
woman
on
the
internet
and
take
her
home
We
never
painted
by
the
numbers,
baby
But
we
were
making
it
count
You
know
the
greatest
loves
of
all
time
are
over
now
I
guess
you
never
know,
never
know
And
it
is
another
day
waking
up
alone
But
we
were
something,
do
not
you
think
so?
Roaring
twenties,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
And
if
my
wishes
came
true
It
would
have
been
you
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
But
it
would
have
been
fun
If
you
would
have
been
the
one
I,
I,
I
persist
and
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
you
If
one
thing
had
been
different
Would
everything
be
different
today?
We
were
something,
do
not
you
think
so?
Rosé
flowing
with
your
chosen
family
And
it
would
have
been
sweet
If
it
could
have
been
me
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
digging
up
the
grave
another
time
But
it
would
have
been
fun
If
you
would
have
been
the
one
(Ooh)
