i
'm
doing
good
,
i
'm
on
some
new
shit
been
saying
``
yes
''
instead
of
``
no
''
i
thought
i
saw
you
at
the
bus
stop
,
i
did
n't
though
i
hit
the
ground
running
each
night
i
hit
the
sunday
matinée
you
know
the
greatest
films
of
all
time
were
never
made
i
guess
you
never
know
,
never
know
and
if
you
wanted
me
,
you
really
should
've
showed
and
if
you
never
bleed
,
you
're
never
gon
na
grow
and
it
's
alright
now
but
we
were
something
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
roaring
twenties
,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
and
if
my
wishes
came
true
it
would
've
been
you
in
my
defense
,
i
have
none
for
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
but
it
would
've
been
fun
if
you
would
've
been
the
one
(
ooh
)
i
have
this
dream
you
're
doing
cool
shit
having
adventures
on
your
own
you
meet
some
woman
on
the
internet
and
take
her
home
we
never
painted
by
the
numbers
,
baby
but
we
were
making
it
count
you
know
the
greatest
loves
of
all
time
are
over
now
i
guess
you
never
know
,
never
know
and
it
's
another
day
waking
up
alone
but
we
were
something
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
roaring
twenties
,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
and
if
my
wishes
came
true
it
would
've
been
you
in
my
defense
,
i
have
none
for
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
but
it
would
've
been
fun
if
you
would
've
been
the
one
i
,
i
,
i
persist
and
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
you
if
one
thing
had
been
different
would
everything
be
different
today
?
we
were
something
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
rosé
flowing
with
your
chosen
family
and
it
would
've
been
sweet
if
it
could
've
been
me
in
my
defense
,
i
have
none
for
digging
up
the
grave
another
time
but
it
would
've
been
fun
if
you
would
've
been
the
one
(
ooh
)
