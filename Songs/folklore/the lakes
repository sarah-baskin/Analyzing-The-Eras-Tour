is
it
romantic
how
all
my
elegies
eulogize
me
?
i
'm
not
cut
out
for
all
these
cynical
clones
these
hunters
with
cell
phones
take
me
to
the
lakes
,
where
all
the
poets
went
to
die
i
do
n't
belong
and
,
my
beloved
,
neither
do
you
those
windermere
peaks
look
like
a
perfect
place
to
cry
i
'm
setting
off
,
but
not
without
my
muse
what
should
be
over
,
burrowed
under
my
skin
in
heart-stopping
waves
of
hurt
i
've
come
too
far
to
watch
some
namedropping
sleaze
tell
me
what
are
my
words
worth
take
me
to
the
lakes
,
where
all
the
poets
went
to
die
i
do
n't
belong
and
,
my
beloved
,
neither
do
you
those
windermere
peaks
look
like
a
perfect
place
to
cry
i
'm
setting
off
,
but
not
without
my
muse
i
want
auroras
and
sad
prose
i
want
to
watch
wisteria
grow
right
over
my
bare
feet
'cause
i
have
n't
moved
in
years
and
i
want
you
right
here
a
red
rose
grew
up
out
of
ice
frozen
ground
with
no
one
around
to
tweet
it
while
i
bathe
in
cliffside
pools
with
my
calamitous
love
and
insurmountable
grief
take
me
to
the
lakes
,
where
all
the
poets
went
to
die
i
do
n't
belong
and
,
my
beloved
,
neither
do
you
those
windermere
peaks
look
like
a
perfect
place
to
cry
i
'm
setting
off
,
but
not
without
my
muse
no
,
not
without
you
