Our
coming-of-age
has
come
and
gone
Suddenly,
this
summer,
it
is
clear
I
never
had
the
courage
of
my
convictions
As
long
as
danger
is
near
And
it
is
just
around
the
corner,
darlin'
'Cause
it
lives
in
me
No,
I
could
never
give
you
peace
But
I
am
a
fire
and
I
will
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
If
your
cascade,
ocean
wave
blues
come
All
these
people
think
love's
for
show
But
I
would
die
for
you
in
secret
The
devil's
in
the
details,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give
you
peace?
Your
integrity
makes
me
seem
small
You
paint
dreamscapes
on
the
wall
I
talk
shit
with
my
friends,
it
is
like
I
am
wasting
your
honor
And
you
know
that
I
would
swing
with
you
for
the
fences
Sit
with
you
in
the
trenches
Give
you
my
wild,
give
you
a
child
Give
you
the
silence
that
only
comes
when
two
people
understand
each
other
Family
that
I
chose,
now
that
I
see
your
brother
as
my
brother
Is
it
enough?
But
there
is
robbers
to
the
east,
clowns
to
the
west
I
would
give
you
my
sunshine,
give
you
my
best
But
the
rain
is
always
going
to
come
if
you
are
standin'
with
me
But
I
am
a
fire
and
I
will
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
If
your
cascade,
ocean
wave
blues
come
All
these
people
think
love's
for
show
But
I
would
die
for
you
in
secret
The
devil's
in
the
details,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give
you
peace?
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give
you
peace?
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give
you
peace?
