our
coming-of-age
has
come
and
gone
suddenly
,
this
summer
,
it
's
clear
i
never
had
the
courage
of
my
convictions
as
long
as
danger
is
near
and
it
's
just
around
the
corner
,
darlin
'
'cause
it
lives
in
me
no
,
i
could
never
give
you
peace
but
i
'm
a
fire
and
i
'll
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
if
your
cascade
,
ocean
wave
blues
come
all
these
people
think
love
's
for
show
but
i
would
die
for
you
in
secret
the
devil
's
in
the
details
,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
would
it
be
enough
if
i
could
never
give
you
peace
?
your
integrity
makes
me
seem
small
you
paint
dreamscapes
on
the
wall
i
talk
shit
with
my
friends
,
it
's
like
i
'm
wasting
your
honor
and
you
know
that
i
'd
swing
with
you
for
the
fences
sit
with
you
in
the
trenches
give
you
my
wild
,
give
you
a
child
give
you
the
silence
that
only
comes
when
two
people
understand
each
other
family
that
i
chose
,
now
that
i
see
your
brother
as
my
brother
is
it
enough
?
but
there
's
robbers
to
the
east
,
clowns
to
the
west
i
'd
give
you
my
sunshine
,
give
you
my
best
but
the
rain
is
always
gon
na
come
if
you
're
standin
'
with
me
but
i
'm
a
fire
and
i
'll
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
if
your
cascade
,
ocean
wave
blues
come
all
these
people
think
love
's
for
show
but
i
would
die
for
you
in
secret
the
devil
's
in
the
details
,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
would
it
be
enough
if
i
could
never
give
you
peace
?
would
it
be
enough
if
i
could
never
give
you
peace
?
would
it
be
enough
if
i
could
never
give
you
peace
?
