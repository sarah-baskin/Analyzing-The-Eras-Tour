i
'm
a
mirrorball
i
'll
show
you
every
version
of
yourself
tonight
i
'll
get
you
out
on
the
floor
shimmering
beautiful
and
when
i
break
,
it
's
in
a
million
pieces
hush
,
when
no
one
is
around
,
my
dear
you
'll
find
me
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
spinning
in
my
highest
heels
,
love
shining
just
for
you
hush
,
i
know
they
said
the
end
is
near
but

'm
still
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
spinning
in
my
highest
heels
,
love
shining
just
for
you
i
want
you
to
know
i
'm
a
mirrorball
i
can
change
everything
about
me
to
fit
in
you
are
not
like
the
regulars
the
masquerade
revelers
drunk
as
they
watch
my
shattered
edges
glisten
hush
,
when
no
one
is
around
,
my
dear
you
'll
find
me
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
spinning
in
my
highest
heels
,
love
shining
just
for
you
hush
,
i
know
they
said
the
end
is
near
but
i
'm
still
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
spinning
in
my
highest
heels
,
love
shining
just
for
you
and
they
called
off
the
circus
,
burned
the
disco
down
when
they
sent
home
the
horses
and
the
rodeo
clowns
i
'm
still
on
that
tightrope
i
'm
still
trying
everything
to
get
you
laughing
at
me
and
i
'm
still
a
believer
,
but
i
do
n't
know
why
i
've
never
been
a
natural
,
all
i
do
is
try
,
try
,
try
i
'm
still
on
that
trapeze
i
'm
still
trying
everything
to
keep
you
looking
at
me
because
i
'm
a
mirrorball
i
'm
a
mirrorball
and
i
'll
show
you
every
version
of
yourself
tonight
