I
want
you
to
know
I
am
a
mirrorball
I
will
show
you
every
version
of
yourself
tonight
I
will
get
you
out
on
the
floor
Shimmering
beautiful
And
when
I
break,
it
is
in
a
million
pieces
Hush,
when
no
one
is
around,
my
dear
You'll
find
me
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in
my
highest
heels,
love
Shining
just
for
you
Hush,
I
know
they
said
the
end
is
near
But
I
am
still
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in
my
highest
heels,
love
Shining
just
for
you
I
want
you
to
know
I
am
a
mirrorball
I
can
change
everything
about
me
to
fit
in
You
are
not
like
the
regulars
The
masquerade
revelers
Drunk
as
they
watch
my
shattered
edges
glisten
Hush,
when
no
one
is
around,
my
dear
You'll
find
me
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in
my
highest
heels,
love
Shining
just
for
you
Hush,
I
know
they
said
the
end
is
near
But
I
am
still
on
my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in
my
highest
heels,
love
Shining
just
for
you
And
they
called
off
the
circus,
burned
the
disco
down
When
they
sent
home
the
horses
and
the
rodeo
clowns
I
am
still
on
that
tightrope
I
am
still
trying
everything
to
get
you
laughing
at
me
And
I
am
still
a
believer,
but
I
do
not
know
why
I
have
never
been
a
natural,
all
I
do
is
try,
try,
try
I
am
still
on
that
trapeze
I
am
still
trying
everything
to
keep
you
looking
at
me
Because
I
am
a
mirrorball
I
am
a
mirrorball
And
I
will
show
you
every
version
of
yourself
tonight
