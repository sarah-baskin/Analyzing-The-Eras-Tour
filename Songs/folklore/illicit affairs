Make
sure
nobody
sees
you
leave
Hood
over
your
head,
keep
your
eyes
down
Tell
your
friends
you
are
out
for
a
run
You'll
be
flushed
when
you
return
Take
the
road
less
traveled
by
Tell
yourself
you
can
always
stop
What
started
in
beautiful
rooms
Ends
with
meetings
in
parking
lots
And
that
is
the
thing
about
illicit
affairs
And
clandestine
meetings
and
longing
stares
It's
born
from
just
one
single
glance
But
it
dies
and
it
dies
and
it
dies
A
million
little
times
Leave
the
perfume
on
the
shelf
That
you
picked
out
just
for
him
So
you
leave
no
trace
behind
Like
you
do
not
even
exist
Take
the
words
for
what
they
are
A
dwindling,
mercurial
high
A
drug
that
only
worked
The
first
few
hundred
times
And
that
is
the
thing
about
illicit
affairs
And
clandestine
meetings
and
stolen
stares
They
show
their
truth
one
single
time
But
they
lie
and
they
lie
and
they
lie
A
million
little
times
And
you
want
to
scream
Don't
call
me
"kid,"
do
not
call
me
"baby"
Look
at
this
godforsaken
mess
that
you
made
me
You
showed
me
colors
you
know
I
cannot
see
with
anyone
else
Don't
call
me
"kid,"
do
not
call
me
"baby"
Look
at
this
idiotic
fool
that
you
made
me
You
taught
me
a
secret
language
I
cannot
speak
with
anyone
else
And
you
know
damn
well
For
you,
I
would
ruin
myself
A
million
little
times
