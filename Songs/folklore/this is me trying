I
have
been
having
a
hard
time
adjusting
I
had
the
shiniest
wheels,
now
they
are
rusting
I
did
not
know
if
you
would
care
if
I
came
back
I
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
Pulled
the
car
off
the
road
to
the
lookout
Could've
followed
my
fears
all
the
way
down
And
maybe
I
do
not
quite
know
what
to
say
But
I
am
here
in
your
doorway
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
They
told
me
all
of
my
cages
were
mental
So
I
got
wasted
like
all
my
potential
And
my
words
shoot
to
kill
when
I
am
mad
I
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
I
was
so
ahead
of
the
curve,
the
curve
became
a
sphere
Fell
behind
all
my
classmates
and
I
ended
up
here
Pouring
out
my
heart
to
a
stranger
But
I
did
not
pour
the
whiskey
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
At
least
I
am
trying
And
it
is
hard
to
be
at
a
party
when
I
feel
like
an
open
wound
It's
hard
to
be
anywhere
these
days
when
all
I
want
is
you
You're
a
flashback
in
a
film
reel
on
the
one
screen
in
my
town
And
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
(And
maybe
I
do
not
quite
know
what
to
say)
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
At
least
I
am
trying
