i
've
been
having
a
hard
time
adjusting
i
had
the
shiniest
wheels
,
now
they
're
rusting
i
did
n't
know
if
you
'd
care
if
i
came
back
i
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
pulled
the
car
off
the
road
to
the
lookout
could
've
followed
my
fears
all
the
way
down
and
maybe
i
do
n't
quite
know
what
to
say
but
i
'm
here
in
your
doorway
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
they
told
me
all
of
my
cages
were
mental
so
i
got
wasted
like
all
my
potential
and
my
words
shoot
to
kill
when
i
'm
mad
i
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
i
was
so
ahead
of
the
curve
,
the
curve
became
a
sphere
fell
behind
all
my
classmates
and
i
ended
up
here
pouring
out
my
heart
to
a
stranger
but
i
did
n't
pour
the
whiskey
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
at
least
i
'm
trying
and
it
's
hard
to
be
at
a
party
when
i
feel
like
an
open
wound
it
's
hard
to
be
anywhere
these
days
when
all
i
want
is
you
you
're
a
flashback
in
a
film
reel
on
the
one
screen
in
my
town
and
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
(
and
maybe
i
do
n't
quite
know
what
to
say
)
i
