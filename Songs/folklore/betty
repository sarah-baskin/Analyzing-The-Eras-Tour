betty
,
i
wo
n't
make
assumptions
about
why
you
switched
your
homeroom
,
but
i
think
it
's
'cause
of
me
betty
,
one
time
,
i
was
riding
on
my
skateboard
when
i
passed
your
house
it
's
like
i
could
n't
breathe
you
heard
the
rumors
from
inez
you
ca
n't
believe
a
word
she
says
most
times
,
but
this
time
,
it
was
true
the
worst
thing
that
i
ever
did
was
what
i
did
to
you
but
if
i
just
showed
up
at
your
party
would
you
have
me
?
would
you
want
me
?
would
you
tell
me
to
go
fuck
myself
or
lead
me
to
the
garden
?
in
the
garden
,
would
you
trust
me
if
i
told
you
it
was
just
a
summer
thing
?

favorite
song
was
playing
from

nowhere
to
be
found
