we
gather
here
,
we
line
up
,
weepin
'
in
a
sunlit
room
and
if
i
'm
on
fire
,
you
'll
be
made
of
ashes
,
too
even
on
my
worst
day
,
did
i
deserve
,
babe
all
the
hell
you
gave
me
?
'cause
i
loved
you
,
i
swear
i
loved
you
'til
my
dying
day
i
did
n't
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
and
you
're
the
hero
flying
around
,
saving
face
and
if
i
'm
dead
to
you
,
why
are
you
at
the
wake
?
cursing
my
name
,
wishing
i
stayed
look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
we
gather
stones
,
never
knowing
what
they
'll
mean
some
to
throw
,
some
to
make
a
diamond
ring
you
know
i
did
n't
want
to
have
to
haunt
you
but
what
a
ghostly
scene
you
wear
the
same
jewels
that
i
gave
you
as
you
bury
me
i
did
n't
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
'cause
when
i
'd
fight
,
you
used
to
tell
me
i
was
brave
and
if
i
'm
dead
to
you
,
why
are
you
at
the
wake
?
cursing
my
name
,
wishing
i
stayed
look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
and
i
can
go
anywhere
i
want
anywhere
i
want
,
just
not
home
and
you
can
aim
for
my
heart
,
go
for
blood
but
you
would
still
miss
me
in
your
bones
and
i
still
talk
to
you
(
when
i
'm
screaming
at
the
sky
)
and
when
you
ca
n't
sleep
at
night
(
you
hear
my
stolen
lullabies
)
i
did
n't
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
and
so
the
battleships
will
sink
beneath
the
waves
you
had
to
kill
me
,
but
it
killed
you
just
the
same
cursing
my
name
,
wishing
i
stayed
you
turned
into
your
worst
fears
and
you
're
tossing
out
blame
,
drunk
on
this
pain
crossing
out
the
good
years
and
you
're
cursing
my
name
,
wishing
i
stayed
look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
