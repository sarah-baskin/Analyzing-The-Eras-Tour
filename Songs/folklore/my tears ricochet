We
gather
here,
we
line
up,
weepin'
in
a
sunlit
room
And
if
I
am
on
fire,
you
will
be
made
of
ashes,
too
Even
on
my
worst
day,
did
I
deserve,
babe
All
the
hell
you
gave
me?
'Cause
I
loved
you,
I
swear
I
loved
you
'Til
my
dying
day
I
did
not
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
And
you
are
the
hero
flying
around,
saving
face
And
if
I
am
dead
to
you,
why
are
you
at
the
wake?
Cursing
my
name,
wishing
I
stayed
Look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
We
gather
stones,
never
knowing
what
they
will
mean
Some
to
throw,
some
to
make
a
diamond
ring
You
know
I
did
not
want
to
have
to
haunt
you
But
what
a
ghostly
scene
You
wear
the
same
jewels
that
I
gave
you
As
you
bury
me
I
did
not
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
'Cause
when
I
would
fight,
you
used
to
tell
me
I
was
brave
And
if
I
am
dead
to
you,
why
are
you
at
the
wake?
Cursing
my
name,
wishing
I
stayed
Look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
And
I
can
go
anywhere
I
want
Anywhere
I
want,
just
not
home
And
you
can
aim
for
my
heart,
go
for
blood
But
you
would
still
miss
me
in
your
bones
And
I
still
talk
to
you
(When
I
am
screaming
at
the
sky)
And
when
you
cannot
sleep
at
night
(You
hear
my
stolen
lullabies)
I
did
not
have
it
in
myself
to
go
with
grace
And
so
the
battleships
will
sink
beneath
the
waves
You
had
to
kill
me,
but
it
killed
you
just
the
same
Cursing
my
name,
wishing
I
stayed
You
turned
into
your
worst
fears
And
you
are
tossing
out
blame,
drunk
on
this
pain
Crossing
out
the
good
years
And
you
are
cursing
my
name,
wishing
I
stayed
Look
at
how
my
tears
ricochet
