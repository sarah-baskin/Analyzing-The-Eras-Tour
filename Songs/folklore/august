the
rust
on
your
door
i
never
needed
anything
more
whispers
of
``
are
you
sure
?
''
``
never
have
i
ever
before
''
but
i
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
august
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in
time
'cause
it
was
never
mine
and
i
can
see
us
twisted
in
bedsheets
august
sipped
away
like
a
bottle
of
wine
'cause
you
were
never
mine
your
back
beneath
the
sun
wishin
'
i
could
write
my
name
on
it
will
you
call
when
you
're
back
at
school
?

remember
thinkin

had
you

for
the
better
wanting

enough
for
me
,
it

enough
to
live
for
the
hope
of
it
all
cancel
plans
just
in

you
'd
call
and
say
,
``
