Salt
air,
and
the
rust
on
your
door
I
never
needed
anything
more
Whispers
of
"Are
you
sure?"
"Never
have
I
ever
before"
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in
time
'Cause
it
was
never
mine
And
I
can
see
us
twisted
in
bedsheets
August
sipped
away
like
a
bottle
of
wine
'Cause
you
were
never
mine
Your
back
beneath
the
sun
Wishin'
I
could
write
my
name
on
it
Will
you
call
when
you
are
back
at
school?
I
remember
thinkin'
I
had
you
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in
time
'Cause
it
was
never
mine
And
I
can
see
us
twisted
in
bedsheets
August
sipped
away
like
a
bottle
of
wine
'Cause
you
were
never
mine
Back
when
we
were
still
changin'
for
the
better
Wanting
was
enough
For
me,
it
was
enough
To
live
for
the
hope
of
it
all
Cancel
plans
just
in
case
you
would
call
And
say,
"Meet
me
behind
the
mall"
So
much
for
summer
love
and
saying
"us"
'Cause
you
were
not
mine
to
lose
You
were
not
mine
to
lose,
no
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in

'Cause
it
was
never
mine

I

August
sipped
away
like
a
bottle
of
wine
'Cause
you
were
never
mine
'Cause
you
were
never
mine
Never
mine
But
do
you
remember?
Remember
when
I
pulled
up
and
said
"Get
in
the
car"
And
then
canceled
my
plans
just
in
case
you
would
call?
Back
when
I
was
livin'
for
the
hope
of
it
all,
for
the
hope
of
it
all
"Meet
me
behind
the
mall"
(Remember
when
I
pulled
up
and
said
"Get
in
the
car")
(And
then
canceled
my
plans
just
in
case
you
would
call?)
(Back

I

livin'
