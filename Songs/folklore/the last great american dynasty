saltbox
house
on

coast
took
her
mind
off
st.
louis
bill

the
heir
to
the
standard
oil
name
and
money
and
the
town
said
,
``
how
did
a
middle-class
divorcée
do
it
?
''
the
wedding
was
charming
,
if
a
little
gauche
there
's
only
so
far
new
money
goes
they
picked
out
a
home
and
called
it
``
holiday
house
''
their
parties
were
tasteful
,
if
a
little
loud
the
doctor
had
told
him
to
settle
down
it
must
have
been
her
fault
his
heart
gave
out
and
they
said
``
there
goes
the
last
great
american
dynasty
who
knows
,
if
she
never
showed
up
,
what
could
've
been
there
goes
the
maddest
woman
this
town
has
ever
seen
she
had
a
marvelous
time
ruining
everything
