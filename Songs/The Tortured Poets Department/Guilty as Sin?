drownin
'
in
the
blue
nile
he
sent
me
``
downtown
lights
''
i
had
n't
heard
it
in
a
while
my
boredom
's
bone-deep
this
cage
was
once
just
fine
am
i
allowed
to
cry
?
i
dream
of
crackin
'
locks
throwin
'
my
life
to
the
wolves
or
the
ocean
rocks
crashin
'
into
him
tonight
,
he
's
a
paradox
i
'm
seeing
visions
am
i
bad
or
mad
or
wise
?
what
if
he
's
written
``
mine
''
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind
?
one
slip
and
fallin
'
back
into
the
hedge
maze
oh
,
what
a
way
to
die
i
keep
recalling
things
we
never
did
messy
top-lip
kiss
,
how
i
long
for
our
trysts
without
ever
touchin
'
his
skin
how
can
i
be
guilty
as
sin
?
i
keep
these
longings
locked
in
lowercase
,
inside
a
vault
someone
told
me
,
``
there
's
no
such
thing
as
bad
thoughts
only
your
actions
talk
''
these
fatal
fantasies
giving
way
to
labored
breath
,
takin
'
all
of
me
we
've
already
done
it
in
my
head
if
it
's
make-believe
why
does
it
feel
like
a
vow
we
'll
both
uphold
somehow
?
what
if
he
's
written
``
mine
''
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind
?
one
slip
and
fallin
'
back
into
the
hedge
maze
oh
,
what
a
way
to
die
my
bed
sheets
are
ablaze
i
've
screamed
his
name
buildin
'
up
like
waves
crashin
'
over
my
grave
without
ever
touchin
'
his
skin
how
can
i
be
guilty
as
sin
?
what
if
i
roll
the
stone
away
?
they
're
gon
na
crucify
me
anyway
what
if
the
way
you
hold
me
is
actually
what
's
holy
?
if
long-suffering
propriety
is
what
they
want
from
me
they
do
n't
know
how
you
've
haunted
me
so
stunningly
i
choose
you
and
me
religiously
what
if
he
's
written
``
mine
''
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind
?
one
slip
and
fallin
'
back
into
