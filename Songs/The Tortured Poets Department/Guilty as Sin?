Drownin'
in
the
Blue
Nile
He
sent
me
"Downtown
Lights"
I
had
not
heard
it
in
a
while
My
boredom's
bone-deep
This
cage
was
once
just
fine
Am
I
allowed
to
cry?
I
dream
of
crackin'
locks
Throwin'
my
life
to
the
wolves
or
the
ocean
rocks
Crashin'
into
him
tonight,
he
is
a
paradox
I
am
seeing
visions
Am
I
bad
or
mad
or
wise?
What
if
he
is
written
"mine"
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind?
One
slip
and
fallin'
back
into
the
hedge
maze
Oh,
what
a
way
to
die
I
keep
recalling
things
we
never
did
Messy
top-lip
kiss,
how
I
long
for
our
trysts
Without
ever
touchin'
his
skin
How
can
I
be
guilty
as
sin?
I
keep
these
longings
locked
In
lowercase,
inside
a
vault
Someone
told
me,
"There's
no
such
thing
as
bad
thoughts
Only
your
actions
talk"
These
fatal
fantasies
Giving
way
to
labored
breath,
takin'
all
of
me
We've
already
done
it
in
my
head
If
it
is
make-believe
Why
does
it
feel
like
a
vow
we
will
both
uphold
somehow?
What
if
he
is
written
"mine"
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind?
One
slip
and
fallin'
back
into
the
hedge
maze
Oh,
what
a
way
to
die
My
bed
sheets
are
ablaze
I
have
screamed
his
name
Buildin'
up
like
waves
crashin'
over
my
grave
Without
ever
touchin'
his
skin
How
can
I
be
guilty
as
sin?
What
if
I
roll
the
stone
away?
They're
going
to
crucify
me
anyway
What
if
the
way
you
hold
me
is
actually
what
is
holy?
If
long-suffering
propriety
is
what
they
want
from
me
They
do
not
know
how
you
have
haunted
me
so
stunningly
I
choose
you
and
me
religiously
What
if
he
is
written
"mine"
on
my
upper
thigh
only
in
my
mind?
One
slip
and
fallin'
back
into
the
hedge
maze
Oh,
what
a
way
to
die
I
keep
recalling
things
we
never
did
Messy
top-lip
kiss,
how
I
long
for
our
trysts
Without
ever
touchin'
his
skin
How
can
I
be
guilty
as
sin?
He
sent
me
"Downtown
Lights"
I
had
not
heard
it
in
a
while
Am
I
allowed
to
cry?
