I
can
read
your
mind
"She's
having
the
time
of
her
life"
There
in
her
glittering
prime
The
lights
refract
sequin
stars
off
her
silhouette
every
night
I
can
show
you
lies
(One,
two,
three,
four)
'Cause
I
am
a
real
tough
kid
I
can
handle
my
shit
They
said,
"Babe,
you
got
to
fake
it
'til
you
make
it"
and
I
did
Lights,
camera,
bitch,
smile
Even
when
you
want
to
die
He
said
he
would
love
me
all
his
life
But
that
life
was
too
short
Breaking
down,
I
hit
the
floor
All
the
pieces
of
me
shattered
as
the
crowd
was
chanting,
"More"
I
was
grinnin'
like
I
am
winnin'
I
was
hittin'
my
marks
'Cause
I
can
do
it
with
a
broken
heart
(One,
two,
three,
four)
I
am
so
depressed,
I
act
like
it
is
my
birthday
every
day
I
am
so
obsessed
with
him,
but
he
avoids
me
like
the
plague
I
cry
a
lot,
but
I
am
so
productive,
it
is
an
art
You
know
you
are
good
when
you
can
even
do
it
with
a
broken
heart
I
can
hold
my
breath
I
have
been
doin'
it
since
he
left
I
keep
finding
his
things
in
drawers
Crucial
evidence
I
did
not
imagine
the
whole
thing
I
am
sure
I
can
pass
this
test
(One,
two,
three,
four)
'Cause
I
am
a
real
tough
kid
I
can
handle
my
shit
They
said,
"Babe,
you
got
to
fake
it
'til
you
make
it"
and
I
did
Lights,
camera,
bitch,
smile
In
stilettos
for
miles
He
said
he
would
love
me
for
all
time
But
that
time
was
quite
short
Breaking
down,
I
hit
the
floor
All
the
pieces
of
me
shattered
as
the
crowd
was
chanting,
"More"
I
was
grinnin'
like
I

every

(He
avoids
me),
like
the
plague
I

I

it
is
an

You
know
you
are
good
when
you
can
even
do
it
with
a
broken
heart
You
know
you
are
good
when
you
can
even
do
it
with
a
broken
heart
You
know
you
are
good
And
I
am
good
'Cause
I
am
miserable
(Haha)
And
nobody
even
knows
Ah,
try
and
come
for
my
job
