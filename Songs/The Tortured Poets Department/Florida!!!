You
can
beat
the
heat
if
you
beat
the
charges
too
They
said
I
was
a
cheat,
I
guess
it
must
be
true
And
my
friends
all
smell
like
weed
or
little
babies
And
this
city
reeks
of
driving
myself
crazy
Little
did
you
know
your
home's
really
only
A
town
you
are
just
a
guest
in
So
you
work
your
life
away
just
to
pay
For
a
time-share
down
in
Destin
Florida
Is
one
hell
of
a
drug
Florida
Can
I
use
you
up?
The
hurricane
with
my
name
when
it
came
I
got
drunk
and
I
dared
it
to
wash
me
away
Barricaded
in
the
bathroom
with
a
bottle
of
wine
Well,
me
and
my
ghosts,
we
had
a
hell
of
a
time
Yes,
I
am
haunted,
but
I
am
feeling
just
fine
All
my
girls
got
their
lace
and
their
crimes
And
your
cheating
husband
disappeared,
well
No
one
asks
any
questions
here
So
I
did
my
best
to
lay
to
rest
All
of
the
bodies
that
have
ever
been
on
my
body
And
in
my
mind,
they
sink
into
the
swamp
Is
that
a
bad
thing
to
say
in
a
song?
Little
did
you
know
your
home's
really
only
The
town
you
will
get
arrested
So
you
pack
your
life
away
just
to
wait
out
The
shitstorm
back
in
Texas
Florida
Is
one
hell
of
a
drug
Florida
Can
I
use
you
up?
I
need
to
forget,
so
take
me
to
Florida
I
have
got
some
regrets,
I
will
bury
them
in
Florida
Tell
me
I
am
despicable,
say
it
is
unforgivable
At
least
the
dolls
are
beautiful,
fuck
me
up,
Florida
I
need
to
forget,
so
take
me
to
Florida
I
have
got
some
regrets,
I
will
bury
them
in
Florida
Tell
me
I
am
despicable,
say
it
is
unforgivable
What
a
crash,
what
a
rush,
fuck
me
up,
Florida
It's
one
hell
of
a
drug
It's
one
hell
of
a
drug
Love
left
me
like
this
and
I
do
not
want
to
exist
So
take
me
to
Florida
Little
did
you
