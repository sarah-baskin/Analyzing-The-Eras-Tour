myself

the
hurricane
with
my
name
when
it
came
i
got
drunk
and
i
dared
it
to
wash
me
away
barricaded
in
the
bathroom
with
a
bottle
of
wine
well
,
me
and
my
ghosts
,
we
had
a
hell
of
a
time
yes
,
i
'm
haunted
,
but
i
'm
feeling
just
fine
all
my
girls
got
their
lace
and
their
crimes
and
your
cheating
husband
disappeared
,
well
no
one
asks
any
questions
here
so
i
did
my
best
to
lay
to
rest
all
of
the
bodies
that
have
ever
been
on
my
body
and
in
my
mind
,
they
sink
into
the
swamp
is
that
a
bad
thing
to
say
in
a
song
?
