Your
hologram
stumbled
into
my
apartment
Hands
in
the
hair
of
somebody
in
darkness
Named
Chloe
or
Sam
or
Sophia
or
Marcus
And
I
just
watched
it
happen
As
the
decade
would
play
us
for
fools
And
you
saw
my
bones
out
with
somebody
new
Who
seemed
like
he
would
have
bullied
you
in
school
And
you
just
watched
it
happen
If
you
want
to
break
my
cold,
cold
heart
Just
say,
"I
loved
you
the
way
that
you
were"
If
you
want
to
tear
my
world
apart
Just
say
you
have
always
wondered
You
said
some
things
that
I
cannot
unabsorb
You
turned
me
into
an
idea
of
sorts
You
needed
me,
but
you
needed
drugs
more
And
I
could
not
watch
it
happen
I
changed
into
goddesses,
villains,
and
fools
Changed
plans
and
lovers
and
outfits
and
rules
All
to
outrun
my
desertion
of
you
And
you
just
watched
it
If
you
want
to
break
my
cold,
cold
heart
Just
say,
"I
loved
you
the
way
that
you
were"
If
you
want
to
tear
my
world
apart
Just
say
you
have
always
wondered
If
the
glint
in
my
eye
traced
the
depths
of
your
sigh
Down
that
passage
in
time
back
to
the
moment
I
crashed
into
you,
like
so
many
wrecks
do
Too
impaired
by
my
youth
to
know
what
to
do
So
if
I
sell
my
apartment
And
you
have
some
kids
with
an
internet
starlet
Will
that
make
your
memory
fade
from
this
scarlet
maroon
Like
it
never
happened?
Could
it
be
enough
to
just
float
in
your
orbit?
Can
we
watch
our
phantoms
like
watching
wild
horses?
Cooler
in
theory,
but
not
if
you
force
it
to
be
It
just
did
not
happen
So
if
you
want
to
break
my
cold,
cold
heart
Say
you
loved
me
And
if
you
want
to
tear
my
world
apart
Say
you
will
always
wonder
'Cause
I
wonder
Will
I
always
Will
I
always
wonder?
