This
happens
once
every
few
lifetimes
These
chemicals
hit
me
like
white
wine
What
if
I
told
you
I
am
back?
The
hospital
was
a
drag
Worst
sleep
that
I
ever
had
I
circled
you
on
a
map
I
have
not
come
around
in
so
long
But
I
am
coming
back
so
strong
So
when
I
touch
down
Call
the
amateurs
and
cut
them
from
the
team
Ditch
the
clowns,
get
the
crown
Baby,
I
am
the
one
to
beat
'Cause
the
sign
on
your
heart
Said
it
is
still
reserved
for
me
Honestly,
who
are
we
to
fight
the
alchemy?
Hey,
you,
what
if
I
told
you
we
are
cool?
That
child's
play
back
in
school
Is
forgiven
under
my
rule
I
have
not
come
around
in
so
long
But
I
am
making
a
comeback
to
where
I
belong
So
when
I
touch
down
Call
the
amateurs
and
cut
them
from
the
team
Ditch
the
clowns,
get
the
crown
Baby,
I
am
the
one
to
beat
'Cause
the
sign
on
your
heart
Said
it
is
still
reserved
for
me
Honestly,
who
are
we
to
fight
the
alchemy?
These
blokes
warm
the
benches
We've
been
on
a
winning
streak
He
jokes
that
it
is
heroin,
but
this
time
with
an
"E"
'Cause
the
sign
on
your
heart
Said
it
is
still
reserved
for
me
Honestly,
who
are
we
to
fight
the
alchemy?
Shirts
off
and
your
friends
lift
you
up
over
their
heads
Beer
stickin'
to
the
floor,
cheers
chanted
because
they
said
"There
was
no
chance
trying
to
be
the
greatest
in
the
league"
Where's
the
trophy?
He
just
comes
runnin'
over
to
me
Touchdown
Call
the
amateurs
and
cut
them
from
the
team
Ditch
the
clowns,
get
the
