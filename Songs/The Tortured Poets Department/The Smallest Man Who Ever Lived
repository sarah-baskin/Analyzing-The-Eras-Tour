was
any
of
it
true
?
gazing
at
me
starry-eyed
in
your
jehovah
's
witness
suit
who
the
fuck
was
that
guy
?
you
tried
to
buy
some
pills
from
a
friend
of
friends
of
mine
they
just
ghosted
you
now
you
know
what
it
feels
like
and
i
do
n't
even
want
you
back
,
i
just
want
to
know
if
rusting
my
sparkling
summer
was
the
goal
and
i
do
n't
miss
what
we
had
,
but
could
someone
give
a
message
to
the
smallest
man
who
ever
lived
?
you
hung
me
on
your
wall
stabbed
me
with
your
push
pins
in
public
,
showed
me
off
then
sank
in
stoned
oblivion
'cause
once
your
queen
had
come
you
'd
treat
her
like
an
also-ran
you
did
n't
measure
up
in
any
measure
of
a
man
and
i
do
n't
even
want
you
back
,
i
just
want
to
know
if
rusting
my
sparkling
summer
was
the
goal
and
i
do
n't
miss
what
we
had
,
but
could
someone
give
a
message
to
the
smallest
man
who
ever
lived
?
were
you
sent
by
someone
who
wanted
me
dead
?
did
you
sleep
with
a
gun
underneath
our
bed
?
were
you
writin
'
a
book
?
were
you
a
sleeper
cell
spy
?
in
fifty
years
,
will
all
this
be
declassified
?
and
you
'll
confess
why
you
did
it
and
i
'll
say
,
``
good
riddance
''
'cause
it
was
n't
sexy
once
it
was
n't
forbidden
i
would
've
died
for
your
sins
,
instead
,
i
just
died
inside
and
you
deserve
prison
,
but
you
wo
n't
get
time
you
'll
slide
into
inboxes
and
slip
through
the
bars
you
crashed
my
party
and
your
rental
car
you
said
normal
girls
were
boring
but
you
were
gone
by
the
morning
you
kicked
out
the
stage
lights
,
but
you
're
still
performing
and
in
plain
sight
you
hid
but
you
are
what
you
did
and
i
'll
forget
you
,
but
i
'll
never
forgive
the
smallest
man
who
ever
lived
