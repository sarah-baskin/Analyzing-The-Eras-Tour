Who's
going
to
stop
us
from
waltzing
back
into
rekindled
flames
If
we
know
the
steps
anyway?
We
embroidered
the
memories
of
the
time
I
was
away
Stitching,
"We
were
just
kids,
babe"
I
said,
"I
do
not
mind,
it
takes
time"
I
thought
I
was
better
safe
than
starry-eyed
I
felt
aglow
like
this
Never
before
and
never
since
If
you
know
it
in
one
glimpse,
it
is
legendary
You
and
I
go
from
one
kiss
to
getting
married
Still
alive,
killing
time
at
the
cemetery
Never
quite
buried
In
your
suit
and
tie,
in
the
nick
of
time
You
low-down
boy,
you
stand-up
guy
You
Holy
Ghost,
you
told
me
I
am
the
love
of
your
life
You
said
I
am
the
love
of
your
life
About
a
million
times
Who's
going
to
tell
me
the
truth
when
you
blew
in
with
the
winds
of
fate
And
told
me
I
reformed
you?
When
your
impressionist
paintings
of
heaven
turned
out
to
be
fakes
Well,
you
took
me
to
hell
too
And
all
at
once,
the
ink
bleeds
A
con
man
sells
a
fool
a
get-love-quick
scheme
But
I
have
felt
a
hole
like
this
Never
before
and
ever
since
If
you
know
it
in
one
glimpse,
it
is
legendary
What
we
thought
was
for
all
time
was
momentary
Still
alive,
killing
time
at
the
cemetery
Never
quite
buried
You
cinephile
in
black
and
white
All
those
plot
twists
and
dynamite
Mr.
Steal
Your
Girl,
then
make
her
cry
You
said
I
am
the
love
of
your
life
You
shit-talked
me
under
the
table
Talkin'
rings
and
talkin'
cradles
I
wish
I
could
un-recall
How
we
almost
had
it
all
Dancing
phantoms
on
the
terrace
Are
they
second-hand
embarrassed
That
I
cannot
get
out
of
bed
'Cause
something
counterfeit's
dead?
It
was
legendary
It
was
momentary
It
was
unnecessary
Should've
let
it
stay
buried
Oh,
what
a
valiant
roar
What
a
bland
goodbye
The
coward
claimed
he
was
a
lion
I
am
combing
through
the
braids
of
lies
"I'll
never
leave,"
"Never
mind"
Our
field
of
dreams
engulfed
in
fire
Your
arson's
match,
your
somber
eyes
And
I
will
still
see
it
until
I
die
You're
the
loss
of
my
life
