who
's
gon
na
stop
us
from
waltzing
back
into
rekindled
flames
if
we
know
the
steps
anyway
?
we
embroidered
the
memories
of
the
time
i
was
away
stitching
,
``
we
were
just
kids
,
babe
''
i
said
,
``
i
do
n't
mind
,
it
takes
time
''
i
thought
i
was
better
safe
than
starry-eyed
i
felt
aglow
like
this
never
before
and
never
since
if
you
know
it
in
one
glimpse
,
it
's
legendary
you
and
i
go
from
one
kiss
to
getting
married
still
alive
,
killing
time
at
the
cemetery
never
quite
buried
in
your
suit
and
tie
,
in
the
nick
of
time
you
low-down
boy
,
you
stand-up
guy
you
holy
ghost
,
you
told
me
i
'm
the
love
of
your
life
you
said
i
'm
the
love
of
your
life
about
a
million
times
who
's
gon
na
tell
me
the
truth
when
you
blew
in
with
the
winds
of
fate
and
told
me
i
reformed
you
?
when
your
impressionist
paintings
of
heaven
turned
out
to
be
fakes
well
,
you
took
me
to
hell
too
and
all
at
once
,
the
ink
bleeds
a
con
man
sells
a
fool
a
get-love-quick
scheme
but
i
've
felt
a
hole
like
this
never
before
and
ever
since
if
you
know
it
in
one
glimpse
,
it
's
legendary
what
we
thought
was
for
all
time
was
momentary
still
alive
,
killing
time
at
the
cemetery
never
quite
buried
you
cinephile
in
black
and
white
all
those
plot
twists
and
dynamite
mr.
steal
your
girl
,
then
make
her
cry
you
said
i
'm
the
love
of
your
life
you
shit-talked
me
under
the
table
talkin
'
rings
and
talkin
'
cradles
i
wish
i
could
un-recall
how
we
almost
had
it
all
dancing
phantoms
on
the
terrace
are
they
second-hand
embarrassed
that
i
ca
n't
get
out
of
bed
'cause
something
counterfeit
's
dead
?
it
was
legendary
it
was
momentary
it
was
unnecessary
should
've
let
it
stay
buried
oh
,
what
a
valiant
roar
what
a
bland
goodbye
the
coward
claimed
he
was
a
lion
i
'm
combing
through
the
braids
of
lies
``
i
'll
never
leave
,
''
``
never
mind
''
our
field
of
dreams
engulfed
in
fire
your
arson
's
match
,
your
somber
eyes
and
i
'll
still
see
it
until
i
die
you
're
the
loss
of
my
life
