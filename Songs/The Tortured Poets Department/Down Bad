Did
you
really
beam
me
up
In
a
cloud
of
sparkling
dust
Just
to
do
experiments
on?
Tell
me
I
was
the
chosen
one
Showed
me
that
this
world
is
bigger
than
us
Then
sent
me
back
where
I
came
from
For
a
moment,
I
knew
cosmic
love
Now
I
am
down
bad,
cryin'
at
the
gym
Everything
comes
out
teenage
petulance
"Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him"
"I
might
just
die,
it
would
make
no
difference"
Down
bad,
wakin'
up
in
blood
Starin'
at
the
sky,
come
back
and
pick
me
up
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
us
I
might
just
not
get
up,
I
might
stay
Down
bad
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
Down
bad
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
Did
you
take
all
my
old
clothes
Just
to
leave
me
here,
naked
and
alone
In
a
field
in
my
same
old
town
That
somehow
seems
so
hollow
now?
They'll
say
I
am
nuts
if
I
talk
about
The
existence
of
you
For
a
moment,
I
was
heavenstruck
Now
I
am
down
bad,
cryin'
at
the
gym
(Cryin'
at
the
gym)
Everything
comes
out
teenage
petulance
"Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him"
(Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him)
"I
might
just
die,
it
would
make
no
difference"
Down
bad,
wakin'
up
in
blood
(Wakin'
up
in
blood)
Starin'
at
the
sky,
come
back
and
pick
me
up
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
us
I
might
just
not
get
up,
I
might
stay
Down
bad
(Like
I
lost
my
twin)
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
(Down
bad)
Down
bad
(Wavin'
at
the
ship)
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
I
loved
your
hostile
takeovers
Encounters
closer
and
closer
All
your
indecent
exposures
How
dare
you
say
that
it
is
-
I
will
build
you
a
fort
on
some
planet
Where
they
can
all
understand
it
How
dare
you
think
it
is
romantic
Leaving
me
safe
and
stranded
'Cause
fuck
it,
I
was
in
love
So
fuck
you
if
I
cannot
have
us
'Cause
fuck
it,
I
was
in
love
Now
I
am
down
bad,
cryin'
at
the
gym
(Cryin'
at
the
gym)
Everything
comes
out
teenage
petulance
"Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him"
(Can't
have
him)
"I
might
just
die,
it
would
make
no
difference"
Down
bad,
wakin'
up
in
blood
(Wakin'
up
in
blood)
Starin'
at
the
sky,
come
back
and
pick
me
up
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
us
I
might
just
not
get
up,
I
might
stay
Down
bad
(Like
I
lost
my
twin)
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
(I'm
down
bad)
Down
bad
(Wavin'
at
the
ship)
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
Like
I
lost
my
twin
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
Down
bad
(Wavin'
at
the
ship)
Fuck
it
if
I
cannot
have
him
