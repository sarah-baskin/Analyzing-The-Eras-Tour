Forgive
me,
Peter
My
lost
fearless
leader
In
closets
like
cedar
Preserved
from
when
we
were
just
kids
Is
it
somethin'
I
did?
The
goddess
of
timing
Once
found
us
beguiling
She
said
she
was
trying
Peter,
was
she
lying?
My
ribs
get
the
feeling
she
did
And
I
did
not
want
to
come
down
I
thought
it
was
just
goodbye
for
now
You
said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Words
from
the
mouths
of
babes
Promises
oceans-deep
But
never
to
keep
Oh,
never
to
keep
Are
you
still
a
mind
reader?
A
natural
scene-stealer?
I
have
heard
great
things,
Peter
But
life
was
always
easier
on
you
Than
it
was
on
me
And
sometimes
it
gets
me
When
crossing
your
jet
stream
We
both
did
the
best
we
could
do
Underneath
the
same
moon
In
different
galaxies
And
I
did
not
want
to
hang
around
We
said
it
was
just
goodbye
for
now
You
said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Words
from
the
mouths
of
babes
Promises
oceans-deep
But
never
to
keep
Never
to
keep
And
I
will
not
confess
that
I
waited,
but
I
let
the
lamp
burn
As
the
men
masqueraded,
I
hoped
you
would
return
With
your
feet
on
the
ground,
tell
me
all
that
you
would
learned
'Cause
love's
never
lost
when
perspective
is
earned
And
you
said
you
would
come
and
get
me,
but
you
were
twenty-five
And
the
shelf
life
of
those
fantasies
has
expired
Lost
to
the
"Lost
Boys"
chapter
of
your
life
Forgive
me,
Peter,
please
know
that
I
tried
To
hold
on
(Hold
on)
to
the
days
(To
the
days)
When
you
were
mine
But
the
woman
who
sits
by
the
window
Has
turned
out
the
light
You
said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
You
said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
You
said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Said
you
were
going
to
grow
up
Then
you
were
going
to
come
find
me
Words
from
the
mouths
of
babes
Promises
oceans-deep
But
never
to
keep
