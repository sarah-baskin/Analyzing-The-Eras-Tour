By
all
accounts,
she
almost
drowned
When
she
was
six
in
frigid
water
And
I
can
confirm
she
made
A
curious
child,
ever
reviled
By
everyone
except
her
own
father
With
a
quite
bewitching
face
Splendidly
selfish,
charmingly
helpless
Excellent
fun
'til
you
get
to
know
her
Then
she
runs
like
it
is
a
race
Behind
her
back,
her
best
mates
laughed
And
they
nicknamed
her
"The
Bolter"
Started
with
a
kiss
"Oh,
we
must
stop
meeting
like
this"
But
it
always
ends
up
with
a
town
car
speeding
Out
the
drive
one
evening
Ended
with
the
slam
of
a
door
Then
he
will
call
her
a
whore
Wish
he
would
not
be
sore
But
as
she
was
leaving
It
felt
like
breathing
All
her
fuckin'
lives
Flashed
before
her
eyes
It
feels
like
the
time
She
fell
through
the
ice
Then
came
out
alive
He
was
a
cad,
wanted
her
bad
Just
like
any
good
trophy
hunter
And
she
liked
the
way
it
tastes
Taming
a
bear,
making
him
care
Watching
him
jump
then
pulling
him
under
And
at
first
blush,
this
is
fate
When
it
is
all
roses,
portrait
poses
Central
Park
Lake
in
tiny
rowboats
What
a
charming
Saturday
That's
when
she
sees
the
littlest
leaks
Down
in
the
floorboards
And
she
just
knows
she
must
bolt
Started
with
a
kiss
"Oh,
we
must
stop
meeting
like
this"
But
it
always
ends
up
with
a
town
car
speeding

Ended

not
be
sore
But
as
she
was
leaving
It
felt
like
breathing
All
her
fuckin'
lives
Flashed
before
her
eyes
(Ah-ah-ah)
It
feels
like
the
time
She
fell
through
the
ice
Then
came
out
alive
She's
been
many
places
with
Men
of
many
faces
First,
they
are
off
to
the
races
And
she
is
laughing,
drawin'
aces
But
none
of
it
is
changin'
That
the
chariot
is
waitin'
Hearts
are
hers
for
the
breakin'
There's
escape
in
escaping
Started
with
a
kiss
"Oh,
we
must
stop
meeting
like
this"
But
it
always
ends
up
with
a
town
car
speeding
Out
the
drive
one
evenin'
Ended
with
the
slam
of
a
door
But
she
is
got
the
best
stories
You
can
be
sure
That
as
she
was
leaving
It
felt
like
freedom
All
her
fuckin'
lives
Flashed
before
her
eyes
(And
she
realized)
It
feels
like
the
time
She
fell
through
the
ice
Then
came
out
alive
