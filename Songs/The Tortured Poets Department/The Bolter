by
all
accounts
,
she
almost
drowned
when
she
was
six
in
frigid
water
and
i
can
confirm
she
made
a
curious
child
,
ever
reviled
by
everyone
except
her
own
father
with
a
quite
bewitching
face
splendidly
selfish
,
charmingly
helpless
excellent
fun
'til
you
get
to
know
her
then
she
runs
like
it
's
a
race
behind
her
back
,
her
best
mates
laughed
and
they
nicknamed
her
``
the
bolter
''
started
with
a
kiss
``
oh
,
we
must
stop
meeting
like
this
''
but
it
always
ends
up
with
a
town
car
speeding
out
the
drive
one
evening
ended
with
the
slam
of
a
door
then
he
'll
call
her
a
whore
wish
he
would
n't
be
sore
but
as
she
was
leaving
it
felt
like
breathing
all
her
fuckin
'
lives
flashed
before
her
eyes
it
feels
like
the
time
she
fell
through
the
ice
then
came
out
alive
he
was
a
cad
,
wanted
her
bad
just
like
any
good
trophy
hunter
and
she
liked
the
way
it
tastes
taming
a
bear
,
making
him
care
watching
him
jump
then
pulling
him
under
and
at
first
blush
,
this
is
fate
when
it
's
all
roses
,
portrait
poses
central
park
lake
in
tiny
rowboats
what
a
charming
saturday
that
's
when
she
sees
the
littlest
leaks
down
in
the
floorboards
and
she
just
knows
she
must
bolt

with
a
kiss

been
many
places
with
men
of

,
they
're
off
to
the
races
