When
I
picture
my
hometown
There's
a
bronze,
spray-tanned
statue
of
you
And
a
plaque
underneath
it
That
threatens
to
push
me
down
the
stairs
at
our
school
And
it
was
always
the
same
searing
pain
But
I
dreamed
that
one
day
I
could
say
All
that
time
you
were
throwin'
punches,
I
was
buildin'
somethin'
And
I
cannot
forgive
the
way
you
made
me
feel
Screamed,
"Fuck
you,
Aimee"
to
the
night
sky
as
the
blood
was
gushin'
But
I
cannot
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
And
it
was
not
a
fair
fight
Or
a
clean
kill
each
time
that
Aimee
stomped
across
my
grave
And
then
she
wrote
headlines
In
the
local
paper,
laughing
at
each
baby
step
I
would
take
And
it
was
always
the
same
searing
pain
But
I
prayed
that
one
day
I
could
say
All
that
time
you
were
throwin'
punches,
I
was
buildin'
somethin'
And
I
could
not
wait
to
show
you
it
was
real
Screamed,
"Fuck
you,
Aimee"
to
the
night
sky
as
the
blood
was
gushin'
But
I
cannot
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
Everyone
knows
that
my
mother
is
a
saintly
woman
But
she
used
to
say
she
wished
that
you
were
dead
I
pushed
each
boulder
up
the
hill
Your
words
are
still
just
ringin'
in
my
head,
ringin'
in
my
head
I
wrote
a
thousand
songs
that
you
find
uncool
I
built
a
legacy
that
you
cannot
undo
But
when
I
count
the
scars,
there
is
a
moment
of
truth
That
there
would
not
be
this
if
there
had
not
been
you
And
maybe
you
have
reframed
it
And
in
your
mind,
you
never
beat
my
spirit
black
and
blue
I
do
not
think
you
have
changed
much
And
so
I
changed
your
name
and
any
real
defining
clues
And
one
day,
your
kid
comes
home
singin'
A
song
that
only
us
two
is
going
to
know
is
about
you,
because
All
that
time
you
were
throwin'
punches,
it
was
all
for
nothin'
And
our
town,
it
looks
so
small
from
way
up
here
Screamed,
"Thank
you,
Aimee"
to
the
night
sky
and
the
stars
are
stunnin'
'Cause
I
cannot
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
Everyone
knows
that
my
mother
is
a
saintly
woman
But
she
used
to
say
she
wished
that
you
were
dead
So
I
pushed
each
boulder
up
that
hill
Your
words
were
still
just
ringin'
in
my
head,
ringin'
in
my
head
Thank
you,
Aimee
Thank
you,
Aimee
