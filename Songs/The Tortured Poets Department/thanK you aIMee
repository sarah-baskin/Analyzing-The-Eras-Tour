when
i
picture
my
hometown
there
's
a
bronze
,
spray-tanned
statue
of
you
and
a
plaque
underneath
it
that
threatens
to
push
me
down
the
stairs
at
our
school
and
it
was
always
the
same
searing
pain
but
i
dreamed
that
one
day
i
could
say
all
that
time
you
were
throwin
'
punches
,
i
was
buildin
'
somethin
'
and
i
ca
n't
forgive
the
way
you
made
me
feel
screamed
,
``
fuck
you
,
aimee
''
to
the
night
sky
as
the
blood
was
gushin
'
but
i
ca
n't
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
and
it
was
n't
a
fair
fight
or
a
clean
kill
each
time
that
aimee
stomped
across
my
grave
and
then
she
wrote
headlines
in
the
local
paper
,
laughing
at
each
baby
step
i
'd
take
and
it
was
always
the
same
searing
pain
but
i
prayed
that
one
day
i
could
say
all
that
time
you
were
throwin
'
punches
,
i
was
buildin
'
somethin
'
and
i
could
n't
wait
to
show
you
it
was
real
screamed
,
``
fuck
you
,
aimee
''
to
the
night
sky
as
the
blood
was
gushin
'
but
i
ca
n't
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
everyone
knows
that
my
mother
is
a
saintly
woman
but
she
used
to
say
she
wished
that
you
were
dead
i
pushed
each
boulder
up
the
hill
your
words
are
still
just
ringin
'
in
my
head
,
ringin
'
in
my
head
i
wrote
a
thousand
songs
that
you
find
uncool
i
built
a
legacy
that
you
ca
n't
undo
but
when
i
count
the
scars
,
there
's
a
moment
of
truth
that
there
would
n't
be
this
if
there
had
n't
been
you
and
maybe
you
've
reframed
it
and
in
your
mind
,
you
never
beat
my
spirit
black
and
blue
i
do
n't
think
you
've
changed
much
and
so
i
changed
your
name
and
any
real
defining
clues
and
one
day
,
your
kid
comes
home
singin
'
a
song
that
only
us
two
is
gon
na
know
is
about
you
,
'cause
all
that
time
you
were
throwin
'
punches
,
it
was
all
for
nothin
'
and
our
town
,
it
looks
so
small
from
way
up
here
screamed
,
``
thank
you
,
aimee
''
to
the
night
sky
and
the
stars
are
stunnin
'
'cause
i
ca
n't
forget
the
way
you
made
me
heal
everyone
knows
that
my
mother
is
a
saintly
woman
but
she
used
to
say
she
wished
that
you
were
dead
so
i
pushed
each
boulder
up
that
hill
your
words
were
still
just
ringin
'
in
my
head
,
ringin
'
in
my
head
thank
you
,
aimee
