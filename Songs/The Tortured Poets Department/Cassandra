i
was
in
my
new
house
placing
daydreams
patching
up
the
crack
along
the
wall
i
pass
it
and
lose
track
of
what
i
'm
saying
'cause
that
's
where
i
was
when
i
got
the
call
when
the
first
stone
's
thrown
,
there
's
screamin
'
in
the
streets
,
there
's
a
raging
riot
when
it
's
``
burn
the
bitch
,
''
they
're
shrieking
when
the
truth
comes
out
,
it
's
quiet
so
,
they
killed
cassandra
first
'cause
she
feared
the
worst
and
tried
to
tell
the
town
so
they
filled
my
cell
with
snakes
,
i
regret
to
say
do
you
believe
me
now
?
i
was
in
my
tower
weaving
nightmares
twisting
all
my
smiles
into
snarls
they
say
,
``
what
does
n't
kill
you
makes
you
aware
''
what
happens
if
it
becomes
who
you
are
?
so
,
they
killed
cassandra
first
'cause
she
feared
the
worst
and
tried
to
tell
the
town
so
they
set
my
life
in
flames
,
i
regret
to
say
do
you
believe
me
now
?
they
knew
,
they
knew
,
they
knew
the
whole
time
that
i
was
onto
somethin
'
the
family
,
the
pure
greed
,
the
christian
chorus
line
they
all
said
nothin
'
blood
's
thick
,
but
nothin
'
like
a
payroll
bet
they
never
spared
a
prayer
for
my
soul
you
can
mark
my
words
that
i
said
it
first
in
a
mourning
warning
,
no
one
heard
i
patched
up
the
crack
along
the
wall
i
pass
it
and
lose
track
of
what
i
'm
saying
'cause
that
's
where
i
was
when
i
lost
it
all
so
,
they
killed
cassandra
first
'cause
she
feared
the
worst
and
tried
to
tell
the
town
so
they
filled
my
cell
with
snakes
,
i
regret
to
say
do
you
believe
me
now
?
ah
,
ah
,
ah
i
was
onto
somethin
