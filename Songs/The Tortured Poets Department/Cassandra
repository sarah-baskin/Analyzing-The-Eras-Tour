I
was
in
my
new
house
placing
daydreams
Patching
up
the
crack
along
the
wall
I
pass
it
and
lose
track
of
what
I
am
saying
'Cause
that
is
where
I
was
when
I
got
the
call
When
the
first
stone's
thrown,
there
is
screamin'
In
the
streets,
there
is
a
raging
riot
When
it
is
"Burn
the
bitch,"
they
are
shrieking
When
the
truth
comes
out,
it
is
quiet
So,
they
killed
Cassandra
first
because
she
feared
the
worst
And
tried
to
tell
the
town
So
they
filled
my
cell
with
snakes,
I
regret
to
say
Do
you
believe
me
now?
I
was
in
my
tower
weaving
nightmares
Twisting
all
my
smiles
into
snarls
They
say,
"What
does
not
kill
you
makes
you
aware"
What
happens
if
it
becomes
who
you
are?
So,
they
killed
Cassandra
first
because
she
feared
the
worst
And
tried
to
tell
the
town
So
they
set
my
life
in
flames,
I
regret
to
say
Do
you
believe
me
now?
They
knew,
they
knew,
they
knew
the
whole
time
That
I
was
onto
somethin'
The
family,
the
pure
greed,
the
Christian
chorus
line
They
all
said
nothin'
Blood's
thick,
but
nothin'
like
a
payroll
Bet
they
never
spared
a
prayer
for
my
soul
You
can
mark
my
words
that
I
said
it
first
In
a
mourning
warning,
no
one
heard
I
patched
up
the
crack
along
the
wall
I
pass
it
and
lose
track
of
what
I
am
saying
'Cause
that
is
where
I
was
when
I
lost
it
all
So,
they
killed
Cassandra
first
because
she
feared
the
worst
And
tried
to
tell
the
town
So
they
filled
my
cell
with
snakes,
I
regret
to
say
Do
you
believe
me
now?
Ah,
ah,
ah
I
was
onto
somethin'
Ah,
ah
They
all
said
nothin'
Blood's
thick
but
nothin'
like
a
payroll
Bet
they
never
spared
a
prayer
for
my
soul
You
can
mark
my
words
that
I
said
it
first
In
a
mourning
warning,
no
one
heard
No
one
heard,
not
a
single
word
was
heard
When
the
first
stone's
thrown,
there
is
screamin'
In
the
streets,
there
is
a
raging
riot
When
it
is
"Burn
the
bitch,"
they
are
shrieking
When
the
truth
comes
out,
it
is
quiet
It's
so
quiet
