Oh,
here
we
go
again
The
voices
in
his
head
Called
the
rain
to
end
our
days
of
wild
The
sickest
army
doll
Purchased
at
the
mall
Rivulets
descend
my
plastic
smile
But
you
should
have
seen
him
when
he
first
got
me
My
boy
only
breaks
his
favorite
toys,
toys,
oh
I
am
queen
of
sand
castles
he
destroys,
oh,
oh
'Cause
it
fit
too
right,
puzzle
pieces
in
the
dead
of
night
I
should
have
known
it
was
a
matter
of
time,
oh,
oh
My
boy
only
breaks
his
favorite
toys,
oh,
oh
There
was
a
litany
of
reasons
why
We
could
have
played
for
keeps
this
time
I
know
I
am
just
repeating
myself
Put
me
back
on
my
shelf
But
first,
pull
the
string
And
I
will
tell
you
that
he
runs
Because
he
loves
me
(He
loves
me)
'Cause
you
should
have
seen
him
when
he
first
saw
me
My
boy
(My
boy),
only
breaks
his
favorite
toys,
toys,
oh
I
am
queen
(I'm
queen),
of
sand
castles
he
destroys,
oh,
oh
'Cause
I
knew
too
much,
there
was
danger
in
the
heat
of
my
touch
He
saw
forever,
so
he
smashed
it
up,
oh,
oh
My
boy
(My
boy),
only
breaks
his
favorite
toys,
oh,
oh
Once
I
fix
me
He's
going
to
miss
me
Once
I
fix
me
He's
going
to
miss
me
Just
say
when,
I
would
play
again
He
was
my
best
friend
down
at
the
sandlot
I
felt
more
when
we
played
pretend
Than
with
all
the
Kens
'Cause
he
took
me
out
of
my
box
Stole
my
tortured
heart
Left
all
these
broken
parts
Told
me
I
am
better
off
But
I
am
not
I
am
not,
I
am
not
