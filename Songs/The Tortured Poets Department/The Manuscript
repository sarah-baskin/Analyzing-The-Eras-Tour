now
and
then
,
she
rereads
the
manuscript
of
the
entire
torrid
affair
they
compared
their
licenses
he
said
,
``
i
'm
not
a
donor
but
i
'd
give
you
my
heart
if
you
needed
it
''
she
rolled
her
eyes
and
said
``
you
're
a
professional
''
he
said
,
``
no
,
just
a
good
samaritan
''
he
said
that
if
the
sex
was
half
as
good
as
the
conversation
was
soon
,
they
'd
be
pushin
'
strollers
but
,
soon
,
it
was
over
in
the
age
of
him
,
she
wished
she
was
thirty
and
made
coffee
every
morning
in
a
french
press
afterwards
,
she
only
ate
kids
'
cereal
and
could
n't
sleep
unless
it
was
in
her
mother
's
bed
then
she
dated
boys
who
were
her
own
age
with
dart
boards
on
the
backs
of
their
doors
she
thought
about
how
he
said
since
she
was
so
wise
beyond
her
years
everything
had
been
above
board
she
was
n't
sure
and
the
years
passed
like
scenes
of
a
show
the
professor
said
to
write
what
you
know
lookin
'
backwards
might
be
the
only
way
to
move
forward
then
the
actors
were
hitting
their
marks
and
the
slow
dance
was
alight
with
the
sparks
and
the
tears
fell
in
synchronicity
with
the
score
and
at
last
,
she
knew
what
the
agony
had
been
for
the
only
thing
that
's
left
is
the
manuscript
one
last
souvenir
from
my
trip
to
your
shores
now
and
then
,
i
reread
the
manuscript
but
the
story
is
n't
mine
anymore
