You
left
your
typewriter
at
my
apartment
Straight
from
the
tortured
poets
department
I
think
some
things
I
never
say
Like,
"Who
uses
typewriters
anyway?"
But
you
are
in
self-sabotage
mode
Throwing
spikes
down
on
the
road
But
I
have
seen
this
episode
and
still
loved
the
show
Who
else
decodes
you?
And
who
is
going
to
hold
you
like
me?
And
who
is
going
to
know
you,
if
not
me?
I
laughed
in
your
face
and
said
"You're
not
Dylan
Thomas,
I
am
not
Patti
Smith
This
are
not
the
Chelsea
Hotel,
we
are
modern
idiots"
And
who
is
going
to
hold
you
like
me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
You
smoked,
then
ate
seven
bars
of
chocolate
We
declared
Charlie
Puth
should
be
a
bigger
artist
I
scratch
your
head,
you
fall
asleep
Like
a
tattooed
golden
retriever
But
you
awaken
with
dread
Pounding
nails
in
your
head
But
I
have
read
this
one
where
you
come
undone
I
chose
this
cyclone
with
you
And
who
is
going
to
hold
you
like
me?
(Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?)
And
who
is
going
to
know
you
like
me?
(Who's
going
to
know
you?)
I
laughed
in
your
face
and
said
"You're
not
Dylan
Thomas,
I
am
not
Patti
Smith
This
are
not
the
Chelsea
Hotel,
we
are
modern
idiots"
And
who
is
going
to
hold
you
like
me?
(Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?)
No-fucking-body
(Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?)
Nobody
(Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Gonna
know
you?
Gonna
troll
you?)
Nobody
Sometimes,
I
wonder
if
you
are
going
to
screw
this
up
with
me
But
you
told
Lucy
you
would
kill
yourself
if
I
ever
leave
And
I
had
said
that
to
Jack
about
you,
so
I
felt
seen
Everyone
we
know
understands
why
it
is
meant
to
be
'Cause
we
are
crazy
So
tell
me,
who
else
is
going
to
know
me?
At
dinner,
you
take
my
ring
off
my
middle
finger
And
put
it
on
the
one
people
put
wedding
rings
on
And
that
is
the
closest
I
have
come
to
my
heart
exploding
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
(Who?)
Me
Who's
going
to
know
you?
(Who?)
Me
And
you
are
not
Dylan
Thomas,
I
am
not
Patti
Smith
This
are
not
the
Chelsea
Hotel,
we
are
two
idiots
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Who's
going
to
hold
you?
Gonna
know
you?
Gonna
troll
you?
You
left
your
typewriter
at
my
apartment
Straight
from
the
tortured
poets
department
Who
else
decodes
you?
