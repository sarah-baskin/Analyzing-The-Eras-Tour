the
smoke
cloud
billows
out
his
mouth
like
a
freight
train
through
a
small
town
the
jokes
that
he
told
across
the
bar
were
revolting
and
far
too
loud
they
shake
their
heads
sayin
'
,
``
god
,
help
her
''
when
i
tell
'em
he
's
my
man
but
your
good
lord
does
n't
need
to
lift
a
finger
i
can
fix
him
,
no
,
really
,
i
can
and
only
i
can
the
dopamine
races
through
his
brain
on
a
six-lane
texas
highway

hand
so
calloused
from
his
pistol
softly
traces
hearts
on
my
face
and
i
could
see

from
a
mile
away
a
perfect
case
for
my
certain
skill
set
he
had
a
halo
of
the
highest
grade
he
just
had
n't
met
me
yet
they
shake
their
heads
sayin
'
,
``
god
,
help
her
