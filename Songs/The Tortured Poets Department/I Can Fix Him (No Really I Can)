The
smoke
cloud
billows
out
his
mouth
Like
a
freight
train
through
a
small
town
The
jokes
that
he
told
across
the
bar
Were
revolting
and
far
too
loud
They
shake
their
heads
sayin',
"God,
help
her"
When
I
tell
them
he
is
my
man
But
your
good
Lord
does
not
need
to
lift
a
finger
I
can
fix
him,
no,
really,
I
can
And
only
I
can
The
dopamine
races
through
his
brain
On
a
six-lane
Texas
highway
His
hand
so
calloused
from
his
pistol
Softly
traces
hearts
on
my
face
And
I
could
see
it
from
a
mile
away
A
perfect
case
for
my
certain
skill
set
He
had
a
halo
of
the
highest
grade
He
just
had
not
met
me
yet
They
shake
their
heads
sayin',
"God,
help
her"
When
I
tell
them
he
is
my
man
But
your
good
Lord
does
not
need
to
lift
a
finger
I
can
fix
him,
no,
really,
I
can
And
only
I
can
Good
boy,
that
is
right,
come
close
I
will
show
you
Heaven
if
you
will
be
an
angel,
all
night
Trust
me,
I
can
handle
me
a
dangerous
man
No,
really,
I
can
They
shook
their
heads
sayin',
"God,
help
her"
When
I
told
them
he
is
my
man
(I
told
them
he
is
my
man)
But
your
good
Lord
did
not
need
to
lift
a
finger
I
can
fix
him,
no,
really,
I
can
(No,
really,
I
can)
Woah,
maybe
I
cannot
