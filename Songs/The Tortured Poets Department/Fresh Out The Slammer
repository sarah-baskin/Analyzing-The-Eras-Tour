Now,
pretty
baby,
I
am
runnin'
back
home
to
you
Fresh
out
the
slammer,
I
know
who
my
first
call
will
be
to
(Fresh
out
the
slammer,
oh)
Another
summer
takin'
cover,
rolling
thunder
He
do
not
understand
me
Splintered
back
in
winter,
silent
dinners,
bitter
He
was
with
her
in
dreams
Gray
and
blue
and
fights
and
tunnels
Handcuffed
to
the
spell
I
was
under
For
just
one
hour
of
sunshine
Years
of
labor,
locks,
and
ceilings
In
the
shade
of
how
he
was
feeling
But
it
is
going
to
be
alright,
I
did
my
time
Now,
pretty
baby,
I
am
runnin'
back
home
to
you
Fresh
out
the
slammer,
I
know
who
my
first
call
will
be
to
(Fresh
out
the
slammer,
oh)
Camera
flashes,
welcome
bashes,
get
the
matches
Toss
the
ashes
off
the
ledge
As
I
said
in
my
letters,
now
that
I
know
better
I
will
never
lose
my
baby
again
My
friends
tried,
but
I
would
not
hear
it
Watch
me
daily
disappearing
For
just
one
glimpse
of
his
smile
All
those
nights,
he
kept
me
goin'
Swirled
you
into
all
of
my
poems
Now
we
are
at
the
starting
line,
I
did
my
time
Now,
pretty
baby,
I
am
runnin'
To
the
house
where
you
still
wait
up
and
that
porch
light
gleams
(Gleams)
To
the
one
who
says
I
am
the
girl
of
his
American
dreams
And
no
matter
what
I
have
done,
it
would
not
matter
anyway
Ain't
no
way
I
am
going
to
screw
up
now
that
I
know
what
is
at
stake
here
At
the
park
where
we
used
to
sit
on
children's
swings
Wearing
imaginary
rings
But
it
is
going
to
be
alright,
I
did
my
time
