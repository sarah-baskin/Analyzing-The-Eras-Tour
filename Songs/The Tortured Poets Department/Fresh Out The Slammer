call

(
fresh
out

another
summer
takin
'
cover
,
rolling
thunder
he
do
n't
understand
me
splintered
back
in
winter
,
silent
dinners
,
bitter
he
was
with
her
in
dreams
gray
and
blue
and
fights
and
tunnels
handcuffed
to
the
spell
i
was
under
for
just
one
hour
of
sunshine
years
of
labor
,
locks
,
and
ceilings
in
the
shade
of
how
he
was
feeling
but
it
's
gon
na
be
alright
,
i
did
my
time
now
,
pretty
baby
,
i
'm
runnin
'
back
home
to
you
fresh
out
the
slammer
,
i
know
who
my
first
call
will
be
to
(
fresh
out
the
slammer
,
oh
)
camera
flashes
,
welcome
bashes
,
get
the
matches
toss
the
ashes
off
the
ledge
as
i
said
in
my
letters
,
now
that
i
know
better
i
will
never
lose
my
baby
again
my
friends
tried
,
but
i
would
n't
hear
it
watch
me
daily
disappearing
for
just
one
glimpse
of
his
smile
all
those
nights
,
he
kept
me
goin
'
swirled
you
into
all
of
my
poems
now
we
're
at
the
starting
line
,
i
did
my
time
now
,
pretty
baby
,
i
'm
runnin
'
to
the
house
where
you
still
wait
up
and
that
porch
light
gleams
(
gleams
)
to
the
one
who
says
i
'm
the
girl
of
his
american
dreams
and
no
matter
what
i
've
done
,
it
would
n't
matter
anyway
ai
n't
no
way
i
'm
gon
na
screw
up
now
that
i
know
what
's
at
stake
here
at
the
park
where
we
used
to
sit
on
children
's
swings
wearing
imaginary
rings
but
it
's
gon
na
be
alright
,
i
did
my
time
