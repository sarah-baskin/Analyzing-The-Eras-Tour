I
forget
how
the
West
was
won
I
forget
if
this
was
ever
fun
I
just
learned
these
people
only
raise
you
To
cage
you
Sarahs
and
Hannahs
in
their
Sunday
best
Clutchin'
their
pearls,
sighing,
"What
a
mess"
I
just
learned
these
people
try
and
save
you
'Cause
they
hate
you
Too
high
a
horse
For
a
simple
girl
To
rise
above
it
They
slammed
the
door
On
my
whole
world
The
one
thing
I
wanted
Now
I
am
runnin'
with
my
dress
unbuttoned
Screamin',
"But,
Daddy,
I
love
him"
I
am
havin'
his
baby
No,
I
am
not,
but
you
should
see
your
faces
I
am
tellin'
him
to
floor
it
through
the
fences
No,
I
am
not
coming
to
my
senses
I
know
he
is
crazy,
but
he
is
the
one
I
want
Dutiful
daughter,
all
my
plans
were
laid
Tendrils
tucked
into
a
woven
braid
Growin'
up
precocious
sometimes
means
Not
growin'
up
at
all
He
was
chaos,
he
was
revelry
Bedroom
eyes
like
a
remedy
Soon
enough,
the
elders
had
convened
Down
at
the
city
hall
"Stay
away
from
her"
The
saboteurs
Protested
too
much
Lord
knows
the
words
We
never
heard
Just
screeching
tires
and
true
love
And
I
am
runnin'
with
my
dress
unbuttoned
Screamin',
"But,
Daddy,
I
love
him"
I
am
havin'
his
baby
No,
I
am
not,
but
you
should
see
your
faces
I
am
tellin'
him
to
floor
it
through
the
fences
No,
I
am
not
coming
to
my
senses
I
know
he
is
crazy,
but
he
is
the
one
I
want
I
will
tell
you
something
right
now
I
would
rather
burn
my
whole
life
down
Than
listen
to
one
more
second
of
all
this
bitchin'
and
moanin'
I
will
tell
you
something
'bout
my
good
name
It's
mine
alone
to
disgrace
I
do
not
cater
to
all
these
vipers
dressed
in
empath's
clothing
God
save
the
most
judgmental
creeps
Who
say
they
want
what
is
best
for
me
Sanctimoniously
performing
soliloquies
I
will
never
see
Thinkin'
it
can
change
the
beat
Of
my
heart
when
he
touches
me
And
counteract
the
chemistry
And
undo
the
destiny
You
are
not
got
to
pray
for
me
Me
and
my
wild
boy
and
all
of
this
wild
joy
If
all
you
want
is
gray
for
me
Then
it
is
just
white
noise,
and
it
is
just
my
choice
There's
a
lot
of
people
in
town
that
I
Bestow
upon
my
fakest
smiles
Scandal
does
funny
things
to
pride,
but
brings
lovers
closer
We
came
back
when
the
heat
died
down
Went
to
my
parents
and
they
came
around
All
the
wine
moms
are
still
holdin'
out,
but
fuck
'em,
it
is
over
Now
I
am
dancin'
in
my
dress
in
the
sun
and
Even
my
daddy
just
loves
him
I
am
his
lady
And,
oh
my
God,
you
should
see
your
faces
Time,
does
not
it
give
some
perspective?
And,
no,
you
cannot
come
to
the
wedding
I
know
it
is
crazy,
but
he
is
the
one
I
want
I
will
tell
you
something
right
now
You
are
not
got
to
pray
for
me
Me
and
my
wild
boy
and
all
of
this
wild
joy
(He
was
chaos,
he
was
revelry)
If
all
you
want
is
gray
for
me
Then
it
is
just
white
noise,
and
it
is
my
choice
Screamin',
"But,
Daddy,
I
love
him"
I
am
having
his
baby
No,
I
am
not
But
you
should
see
your
faces
But,
oh
my
God,
you
should
see
your
faces
(He
was
chaos,
he
was
revelry)
(He
was
chaos,
he
was
revelry)
