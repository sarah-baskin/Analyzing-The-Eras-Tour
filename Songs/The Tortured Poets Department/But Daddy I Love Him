sarahs
and
hannahs
in
their
sunday
best
clutchin
'
their
pearls
,
sighing
,
``

a
mess
''
i
just
learned
these
people
try
and
save
you
'cause
they
hate
you
too
high
a
horse
for
a
simple
girl
to
rise
above
it
they
slammed
the
door
on
my
whole
world
the
one
thing
i
wanted

'm
runnin
'
with
my
dress
unbuttoned
screamin

coming
to
my
senses
i
know
he
's
crazy
,
but
he
's
the
one
i
want
dutiful
daughter
,
all
my
plans
were
laid
tendrils
tucked
into
a
woven
braid
growin
'
up
precocious
sometimes
means
not
growin
'
up
at
all
he
was
chaos
,
he
was
revelry
bedroom
eyes
like
a
remedy
soon
enough
,
the
elders
had
convened
down
at
the
city
hall
``
stay
away
from
her
''
the
saboteurs
protested
too
much
lord
knows
the
words
we
never
heard
just
screeching
tires
and
true
love
and
i
'm
runnin
'
with
my
dress
unbuttoned
screamin
'
,
``
but
,
daddy
,
i
love
him
''
i
'm
havin
'
his
baby
no
,
i
'm
not
,
but
you
should
see
your
faces
i
'm
tellin
'

to
floor
it
through
the
fences
no
,
i
'm
not
coming
to
my
senses
i
know
he
's
crazy
,
but
he
's
the
one
i
want
i
'll
tell
you
something
right
now
i
'd
rather
burn
my
whole
life
down
than
listen
to
one
more
second
of
all
this
bitchin
'
and
moanin
'
i
'll
tell
you
something
'bout
my
good
name
it
's
mine
alone
to
disgrace
i
do
n't
cater
to
all
these
vipers
dressed
in
empath
's
clothing
god
save
the
most
judgmental
creeps
who
say
they
want
what
's
best
for
me
sanctimoniously
performing
soliloquies
i
'll
never
see
thinkin
'
it
can
change
the
beat
of
my
heart
when
he
touches
me
and
counteract
the
chemistry
and
undo
the
destiny
you
ai
n't
got
ta
pray
for
me
me
and
my
wild
boy
and
all
of
this
wild
joy
if
all
you
want
is
gray
for
me
then
it
's
just
white
noise
,
and
it
's
just
my
choice
there
's
a
lot
of
people
in
town
that
i
bestow
upon
my
fakest
smiles
scandal

funny
things
to
pride
,
but
brings
lovers
closer
