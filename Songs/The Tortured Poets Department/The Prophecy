cards
on
the
table
mine
play
out
like
fools
in
a
fable
oh
,
it
was
sinking
in
(

oh

slow
is
the
quicksand
poison

pricked
hand

sound
like
an
infant
feeling
like
the
very
last
drops
of
an
ink
pen
a
greater
woman
stays
cool
but
i
howl
like
a
wolf
at
the
moon
and
i
look
unstable
gathered
with
a
coven
'round
a
sorceress
'
table
a
greater
woman
has
faith
but
even
statues
crumble
if
they
're
made
to
wait
i
'm
so
afraid
i
sealed
my
fate
no
sign
of
soulmates
i
'm
just
a
paperweight
in
shades
of
greige
spending
my
last
coin
so
someone
will
tell
me
it
'll
be
okay
