One,
two,
three,
four
Hand
on
the
throttle
Thought
I
caught
lightning
in
a
bottle
Oh,
but
it
is
gone
again
And
it
was
written
I
got
cursed
like
Eve
got
bitten
Oh,
was
it
punishment?
Pad
around
when
I
get
home
I
guess
a
lesser
woman
would
have
lost
hope
A
greater
woman
would
not
beg
But
I
looked
to
the
sky
and
said
"Please
I
have
been
on
my
knees
Change
the
prophecy
Don't
want
money
Just
someone
who
wants
my
company
Let
it
once
be
me
Who
do
I
have
to
speak
to
About
if
they
can
redo
the
prophecy?"
Cards
on
the
table
Mine
play
out
like
fools
in
a
fable
Oh,
it
was
sinking
in
(Sinking
in,
oh)
Slow
is
the
quicksand
Poison
blood
from
the
wound
of
the
pricked
hand
Oh,
still
I
dream
of
him
Please
I
have
been
on
my
knees
Change
the
prophecy
Don't
want
money
Just
someone
who
wants
my
company
Let
it
once
be
me
Who
do
I
have
to
speak
to
About
if
they
can
redo
the
prophecy?
And
I
sound
like
an
infant
Feeling
like
the
very
last
drops
of
an
ink
pen
A
greater
woman
stays
cool
But
I
howl
like
a
wolf
at
the
moon
And
I
look
unstable
Gathered
with
a
coven
'round
a
sorceress'
table
A
greater
woman
has
faith
But
even
statues
crumble
if
they
are
made
to
wait
I
am
so
afraid
I
sealed
my
fate
No
sign
of
soulmates
I
am
just
a
paperweight
in
shades
of
greige
Spending
my
last
coin
so
someone
will
tell
me
it
will
be
okay
Ooh,
ooh,
ooh,
ooh
Please
I
have
been
on
my
knees
Change
the
prophecy
Don't
want
money
Just
someone
who
wants
my
company
Let
it
once
be
me
Who
do
I
have
to
speak
to
About
if
they
can
redo
the
prophecy?
Who
do
I
have
to
speak
to
To
change
the
prophecy?
