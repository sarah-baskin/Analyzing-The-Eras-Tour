I
was
supposed
to
be
sent
away
But
they
forgot
to
come
and
get
me
I
was
a
functioning
alcoholic
'Til
nobody
noticed
my
new
aesthetic
All
of
this
to
say
I
hope
you
are
okay
But
you
are
the
reason
And
no
one
here
is
to
blame
But
what
about
your
quiet
treason?
And
for
a
fortnight
there,
we
were
forever
Run
into
you
sometimes,
ask
about
the
weather
Now
you
are
in
my
backyard,
turned
into
good
neighbors
Your
wife
waters
flowers,
I
want
to
kill
her
All
my
mornings
are
Mondays
stuck
in
an
endless
February
I
took
the
miracle
move-on
drug,
the
effects
were
temporary
And
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
touched
you
for
only
a
fortnight
I
touched
you,
but
I
touched
you
And
for
a
fortnight
there,
we
were
forever
Run
into
you
sometimes,
ask
about
the
weather
Now
you
are
in
my
backyard,
turned
into
good
neighbors
Your
wife
waters
flowers,
I
want
to
kill
her
And
for
a
fortnight
there,
we
were
together
Run
into
you
sometimes,
comment
on
my
sweater
Now
you
are
at
the
mailbox,
turned
into
good
neighbors
My
husband
is
cheating,
I
want
to
kill
him
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
touched
you
for
only
a
fortnight
I
touched
you,
I
touched
you
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
love
you,
it
is
ruining
my
life
I
touched
you
for
only
a
fortnight
I
touched
you,
I
touched
you
Thought
of
callin'
ya,
but
you
will
not
pick
up
'Nother
fortnight
lost
in
America
Move
to
Florida,
buy
the
car
you
want
But
it
will
not
start
up
'til
you
touch,
touch,
touch
me
