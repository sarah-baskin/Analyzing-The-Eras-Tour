(Uh-oh,
uh-oh)
We
hereby
conduct
this
post-mortem
He
was
a
hot
house
flower
to
my
outdoorsman
Our
maladies
were
such
we
could
not
cure
them
And
so
a
touch
that
was
my
birthright
became
foreign
Come
one,
come
all,
it
is
happenin'
again
The
empathetic
hunger
descends
We'll
tell
no
one
except
all
of
our
friends
We
must
know
How
did
it
end?
(Uh-oh,
uh-oh)
We
were
blind
to
unforeseen
circumstances
We
learned
the
right
steps
to
different
dances
And
fell
victim
to
interlopers'
glances
Lost
the
game
of
chance,
what
are
the
chances?
Soon,
they
will
go
home
to
their
husbands
Smug
because
they
know
they
can
trust
him
Then
feverishly
calling
their
cousins
"Guess
who
we
ran
into
at
the
shops?
Walking
in
circles
like
she
was
lost
Didn't
you
hear?
They
called
it
all
off"
One
gasp
and
then
"How
did
it
end?"
Say
it
once
again
with
feeling
How
the
death
rattle
breathing
Silenced
as
the
soul
was
leaving
The
deflation
of
our
dreaming
Leaving
me
bereft
and
reeling
My
beloved
ghost
and
me
Sitting
in
a
tree
D-Y-I-N-G
It's
happenin'
again
How
did
it
end?
I
cannot
pretend
like
I
understand
How
did
it
end?
Come
one,
come
all,
it
is
happenin'
again
The
empathetic
hunger
descends
We'll
tell
no
one
except
all
of
our
friends
But
I
still
do
not
know
How
did
it
end
