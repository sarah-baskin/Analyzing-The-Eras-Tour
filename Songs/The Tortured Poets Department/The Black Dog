I
am
someone
who
until
recent
events
You
shared
your
secrets
with
And
your
location,
you
forgot
to
turn
it
off
And
so
I
watch
as
you
walk
Into
some
bar
called
The
Black
Dog
And
pierce
new
holes
in
my
heart
You
forgot
to
turn
it
off
And
it
hits
me
I
just
do
not
understand
How
you
do
not
miss
me
in
The
Black
Dog
When
someone
plays
"The
Starting
Line"
And
you
jump
up,
but
she
is
too
young
to
know
this
song
That
was
intertwined
in
the
magic
fabric
of
our
dreaming
Old
habits
die
screaming
I
move
through
the
world
with
the
heartbroken
My
longings
stay
unspoken
And
I
may
never
open
up
the
way
I
did
for
you
And
all
of
those
best
laid
plans
You
said
I
needed
a
brave
man
Then
proceeded
to
play
him
Until
I
believed
it
too
And
it
kills
me
I
just
do
not
understand
How
you
do
not
miss
me
in
the
shower
And
remember
how
my
rain-soaked
body
Was
shakin',
do
you
hate
me?
Was
it
hazing?
For
a
cruel
fraternity
I
pledged
and
I
still
mean
it
Old
habits
die
screaming
Six
weeks
of
breathin'
clean
air
I
still
miss
the
smoke
Were
you
makin'
fun
of
me
With
some
esoteric
joke?
Now
I
want
to
sell
my
house
And
set
fire
to
all
my
clothes
And
hire
a
priest
to
come
and
exorcise
my
demons
Even
if
I
die
screaming
And
I
hope
you
hear
it
And
I
hope
it
is
shitty
in
The
Black
Dog
When
someone
plays
"The
Starting
Line"
And
you
jump
up,
but
she
is
too
young
to
know
this
song
That
was
intertwined
in
the
tragic
fabric
of
our
dreaming
'Cause
tail
between
your
legs,
you
are
leavin'
I
still
cannot
believe
it
'Cause
old
habits
die
screaming
