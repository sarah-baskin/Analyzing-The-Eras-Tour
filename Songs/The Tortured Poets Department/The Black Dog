i
am
someone
who
until
recent
events
you
shared
your
secrets
with
and
your
location
,
you
forgot
to
turn
it
off
and
so
i
watch
as
you
walk
into
some
bar
called
the
black
dog
and
pierce
new
holes
in
my
heart
you
forgot
to
turn
it
off
and
it
hits
me
i
just
do
n't
understand
how
you
do
n't
miss
me
in
the
black
dog
when
someone
plays
``
the
starting
line
''
and
you
jump
up
,
but
she
's
too
young
to
know
this
song
that
was
intertwined
in
the
magic
fabric
of
our
dreaming
old
habits
die
screaming
i
move
through
the
world
with
the
heartbroken
my
longings
stay
unspoken
and
i
may
never
open
up
the
way
i
did
for
you
and
all
of
those
best
laid
plans
you
said
i
needed
a
brave
man
then
proceeded
to
play
him
until
i
believed
it
too
and
it
kills
me
i
just
do
n't
understand
how
you
do
n't
miss
me
in
the
shower
and
remember
how
my
rain-soaked
body
was
shakin
'
,
do
you
hate
me
?
was
it
hazing
?
for
a
cruel
fraternity
i
pledged
and
i
still
mean
it
old
habits
die
screaming
six
weeks
of
breathin
'
clean
air
i
still
miss
the
smoke
were
you
makin
'
fun
of
me
with
some
esoteric
joke
?
now
i
wan
na
sell
my
house
and
set
fire
to
all
my
clothes
and
hire
a
priest
to
come
and
exorcise
my
demons
even
if
i
die
screaming
and
i
hope
you
hear
it
and
i
hope
it
's
shitty
in
the
black
dog
when
someone
plays
``
the
starting
line
''
and
you
jump
up
,
but
she
's
too
young
to
know
this
song
that
was
intertwined
in
the
tragic
fabric
of
our
dreaming
'cause
tail
between
your
legs
,
you
're
leavin
'
i
still
ca
n't
believe
it
'cause
old
habits
die
screaming
