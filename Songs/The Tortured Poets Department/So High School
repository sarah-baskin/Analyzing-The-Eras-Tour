I
feel
so
high
school
every
time
I
look
at
you
I
want
to
find
you
in
a
crowd
just
to
hide
from
you
And
in
a
blink
of
a
crinklin'
eye
I
am
sinkin',
our
fingers
entwined
Cheeks
pink
in
the
twinklin'
lights
Tell
me
'bout
the
first
time
you
saw
me
I
will
drink
what
you
think
and
I
am
high
From
smokin'
your
jokes
all
damn
night
The
brink
of
a
wrinkle
in
time
Bittersweet
sixteen
suddenly
I
am
watchin'
American
Pie
with
you
on
a
Saturday
night
Your
friends
are
around,
so
be
quiet
I
am
tryin'
to
stifle
my
sighs
'Cause
I
feel
so
high
school
every
time
I
look
at
you
But
look
at
you
Ah-ah,
ah-ah,
ah
Are
you
going
to
marry,
kiss,
or
kill
me?
(Kill
me)
It's
just
a
game,
but
really
(Really)
I
am
bettin'
on
all
three
(All
three)
for
us
two
Get
my
car
door,
is
not
that
sweet?
(That
sweet)
Then
pull
me
to
the
back
seat
(The
back
seat)
No
one's
ever
had
me
(Had
me),
not
like
you
Truth,
dare,
spin
bottles
You
know
how
to
ball,
I
know
Aristotle
Brand
new,
full
throttle
Touch
me
while
your
bros
play
Grand
Theft
Auto
It's
true,
swear,
scout's
honor
You
knew
what
you
wanted
and,
boy,
you
got
her
Brand
new,
full
throttle
You
already
know,
babe
I
feel
like
laughin'
in
the
middle
of
practice
Do
that
impression
you
did
of
your
dad
again
I
am
hearing
voices
like
a
madman
And
in
a
blink
of
a
crinklin'
eye
I
am
sinkin',
our
fingers
entwined
Cheeks
pink
in
the
twinklin'
lights
