long
may
you
reign
you
're
an
animal
,
you
are
bloodthirsty
out
window
panes
talking
utter
nonsense
you
have
no
idea
strings
tied
to
levers
slowed-down
clocks
tethered
all
this
showmanship
to
keep
it
for
you
in
sweetness
way
to
go
,
tiger
higher
and
higher
wilder
and
lighter
for
you
long
may
you
roar
at
your
dinosaurs
you
're
a
just
ruler
covered
in
mud
,
you
look
ridiculous
and
you
have
no
idea
buried
down
deep
and
out
of
your
reach
the
secret
we
all
vowed
to
keep
it
from
you
in
sweetness
way
to
go
,
tiger
higher
and
higher
wilder
and
lighter
for
you
you
got
the
dragonflies
above
your
bed
you
have
a
favorite
spot
on
the
swing
set
you
have
no
room
in
your
dreams
for
regrets
(
you
have
no
idea
)
the
time
will
arrive
for
the
cruel
and
the
mean
you
'll
learn
to
bounce
back
just
like
your
trampoline
but
now
we
'll
curtail
your
curiosity
in
sweetness
way
to
go
,
tiger
(
way
to
go
,
tiger
)
higher
and
higher
(
higher
and
higher
)
wilder
and
lighter
for
you
