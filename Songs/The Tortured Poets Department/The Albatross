Wise
men
once
said
"Wild
winds
are
death
to
the
candle"
A
rose
by
any
other
name
is
a
scandal
Cautions
issued,
he
stood
Shooting
the
messengers
They
tried
to
warn
him
about
her
Cross
your
thoughtless
heart
Only
liquor
anoints
you
She's
the
albatross
She
is
here
to
destroy
you
Wise
men
once
said
"One
bad
seed
kills
the
garden"
"One
less
temptress,
one
less
dagger
to
sharpen"
Locked
me
up
in
towers
But
I
would
visit
in
your
dreams
And
they
tried
to
warn
you
about
me
Cross
your
thoughtless
heart
Only
liquor
anoints
you
She's
the
albatross
She
is
here
to
destroy
you
Devils
that
you
know
Raise
worse
hell
than
a
stranger
She's
the
death
you
chose
You're
in
terrible
danger
And
when
that
sky
rains
fire
on
you
And
you
are
persona
non
grata
I
will
tell
you
how
I
have
been
there
too
And
that
none
of
it
matters
Wise
men
once
read
fake
news
And
they
believed
it
Jackals
raised
their
hackles
You
could
not
conceive
it
You
were
sleeping
soundly
When
they
dragged
you
from
your
bed
And
I
tried
to
warn
you
about
them
So
I
crossed
my
thoughtless
heart
Spread
my
wings
like
a
parachute
I
am
the
albatross
I
swept
in
at
the
rescue
The
devil
that
you
know
Looks
now
more
like
an
angel
I
am
the
life
you
chose
And
all
this
terrible
danger
(This
terrible
danger)
So
cross
your
thoughtless
heart
She's
the
albatross
She
is
here
to
destroy
you
