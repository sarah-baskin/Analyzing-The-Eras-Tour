I
saw
in
my
mind
fairy
lights
through
the
mist
I
kept
calm
and
carried
the
weight
of
the
rift
Pulled
him
in
tighter
each
time
he
was
driftin'
away
My
spine
split
from
carrying
us
up
the
hill
Wet
through
my
clothes,
weary
bones
caught
the
chill
I
stopped
tryna
make
him
laugh,
stopped
tryna
drill
the
safe
Thinkin',
"How
much
sad
did
you
think
I
had
Did
you
think
I
had
in
me?"
Oh,
the
tragedy
So
long,
London
You'll
find
someone
I
did
not
opt
in
to
be
your
odd
man
out
I
founded
the
club
she
is
heard
great
things
about
I
left
all
I
knew,
you
left
me
at
the
house
by
the
Heath
I
stopped
CPR,
after
all,
it
is
no
use
The
spirit
was
gone,
we
would
never
come
to
And
I
am
pissed
off
you
let
me
give
you
all
that
youth
for
free
For
so
long,
London
Stitches
undone
Two
graves,
one
gun
I
will
find
someone
And
you
say
I
abandoned
the
ship
But
I
was
going
down
with
it
My
white-knuckle
dying
grip
Holding
tight
to
your
quiet
resentment
And
my
friends
said
it
is
not
right
to
be
scared
Every
day
of
a
love
affair
Every
breath
feels
like
rarest
air
When
you
are
not
sure
if
he
wants
to
be
there
So
how
much
sad
did
you
think
I
had
Did
you
think
I
had
in
me?
How
much
tragedy?
Just
how
low
did
you
Think
I
would
go
'fore
I
would
self-implode?
'Fore
I
would
have
to
go
be
free?
You
swore
that
you
loved
me,
but
where
were
the
clues?
I
died
on
the
altar
waitin'
for
the
proof
You
sacrificed
us
to
the
gods
of
your
bluest
days
And
I
am
just
getting
color
back
into
my
face
I
am
just
mad
as
hell
because
I
loved
this
place
