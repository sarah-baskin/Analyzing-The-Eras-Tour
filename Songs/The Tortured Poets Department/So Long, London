i
saw
in
my
mind
fairy
lights
through
the
mist
i
kept
calm
and
carried
the
weight
of
the
rift
pulled
him
in
tighter
each
time
he
was
driftin
'
away
my
spine
split
from
carrying
us
up
the
hill
wet
through
my
clothes
,
weary
bones
caught
the
chill
i
stopped
tryna
make
him
laugh
,
stopped
tryna
drill
the
safe
thinkin
'
,
``
how
much
sad
did
you
think
i
had
did
you
think
i
had
in
me
?
''
oh
,
the
tragedy
so
long
,
london
you
'll
find
someone
i
did
n't
opt
in
to
be
your
odd
man
out
i
founded
the
club
she
's
heard
great
things
about
i
left
all
i
knew
,
you
left
me
at
the
house
by
the
heath
i
stopped
cpr
,
after
all
,
it
's
no
use
the
spirit
was
gone
,
we
would
never
come
to
and
i
'm
pissed
off
you
let
me
give
you
all
that
youth
for
free
for
so
long
,
london
stitches
undone
two
graves
,
one
gun
i
'll
find
someone
and
you
say
i
abandoned
the
ship
but
i
was
going
down
with
it
my
white-knuckle
dying
grip
holding
tight
to
your
quiet
resentment
and
my
friends
said
it
is
n't
right
to
be
scared
every
day
of
a
love
affair
every
breath
feels
like
rarest
air
when
you
're
not
sure
if
he
wants
to
be
there
so
how
much
sad
did
you
think
i
had
did
you
think
i
had
in
me
?
how
much
tragedy
?
just
how
low
did
you
think
i
'd
go
'fore
i
'd
self-implode
?
'fore
i
'd
have
to
go
be
free
?
you
swore
that
you
loved
me
,
but
where
were
the
clues
?
i
died
on
the
altar
waitin
'
for
the
proof
you
sacrificed
us
to
the
gods
of
your
bluest
days
and
i
'm
just
getting
color
back
into
my
face
i
'm
just
mad
as
hell
'cause
i
loved
