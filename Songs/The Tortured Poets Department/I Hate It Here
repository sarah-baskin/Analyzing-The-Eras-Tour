Quick,
quick,
tell
me
something
awful
Like
you
are
a
poet
trapped
inside
the
body
of
a
finance
guy
Tell
me
all
your
secrets,
all
you
will
ever
be
is
My
eternal
consolation
prize
You
see,
I
was
a
debutante
in
another
life,
but
Now
I
seem
to
be
scared
to
go
outside
If
comfort
is
a
construct,
I
do
not
believe
in
good
luck
Now
that
I
know
what
is
what
I
hate
it
here
so
I
will
go
to
secret
gardens
in
my
mind
People
need
a
key
to
get
to,
the
only
one
is
mine
I
read
about
it
in
a
book
when
I
was
a
precocious
child
No
mid-sized
city
hopes
and
small-town
fears
I
am
there
most
of
the
year
because
I
hate
it
here
I
hate
it
here
My
friends
used
to
play
a
game
where
We
would
pick
a
decade
We
wished
we
could
live
in
instead
of
this
I
would
say
the
1830s
but
without
all
the
racists
And
getting
married
off
for
the
highest
bid
Everyone
would
look
down
because
it
was
not
fun
now
Seems
like
it
was
never
even
fun
back
then
Nostalgia
is
a
mind's
trick
If
I
would
been
there,
I
would
hate
it
It
was
freezing
in
the
palace
I
hate
it
here
so
I
will
go
to
lunar
valleys
in
my
mind
When
they
found
a
better
planet,
only
the
gentle
survived
I
dreamed
about
it
in
the
dark,
the
night
I
felt
like
I
might
die
No
mid-sized
city
hopes
and
small-town
fears
I
am
there
most
of
the
year
because
I
hate
it
here
I
hate
it
here
I
am
lonely,
but
I
am
good
I
am
bitter,
but
I
swear
I
am
fine
I
will
save
all
my
romanticism
for
my
inner
life
and
I
will
get
lost
on
purpose
This
place
made
me
feel
worthless
Lucid
dreams
like
electricity,
the
current
flies
through
me
And
in
my
fantasies,
I
rise
above
it
And
way
up
there,
I
actually
love
it
I
hate
it
here
so
I
will
go
to
secret
gardens
in
my
mind
People
need
a
key
to
get
to,
the
only
one
is
mine
I
read
about
it
in
a
book
when
I
was
a
precocious
child
No
mid-sized
city
hopes
and
small-town
fears
I
am
there
most
of
the
year
because
I
hate
it
here
I
hate
it
here
Quick,
quick,
tell
me
something
awful
Like
