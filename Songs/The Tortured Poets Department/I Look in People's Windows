i
had
died
the
tiniest
death
i
spied
the
catch
in
your
breath
out
,
out
,
out
,
out
,
out
,
out
northbound
i
got
carried
away
as
you
boarded
your
train
south
,
south
,
south
,
south
,
south
,
south
a
feather
taken
by
the
wind
blowing
i
'm
afflicted
by
the
not
knowing
,
so
i
look
in
people
's
windows
transfixed
by
rose
golden
glows
they
have
their
friends
over
to
drink
nice
wine
i
look
in
people
's
windows
in
case
you
're
at
their
table
what
if
your
eyes
looked
up
and
met
mine
one
more
time
?
you
had
stopped
and
tilted
your
head
i
still
ponder
what
it
meant
now
,
now
,
now
,
now
,
now
,
now
i
tried
searching
faces
on
streets
what
are
the
chances
you
'd
be
downtown
,
downtown
,
downtown
does
it
feel
alright
to
not
know
me
?
i
'm
addicted
to
the
``
if
only
''
so
i
look
in
people
's
windows
like
i
'm
some
deranged
weirdo
i
attend
christmas
parties
from
outside
i
look
in
people
's
windows
in
case
you
're
at
their
table
what
if
your
eyes
looked
up
and
met
mine
one
more
time
?
