I
had
died
the
tiniest
death
I
spied
the
catch
in
your
breath
Out,
out,
out,
out,
out,
out
Northbound
I
got
carried
away
As
you
boarded
your
train
South,
south,
south,
south,
south,
south
[Pre-Chorus]
A
feather
taken
by
the
wind
blowing
I'm
afflicted
by
the
not
knowing,
so
[Chorus]
I
look
in
people's
windows
Transfixed
by
rose
golden
glows
They
have
their
friends
over
to
drink
nice
wine
I
look
in
people's
windows
In
case
you're
at
their
table
What
if
your
eyes
looked
up
and
met
mine
One
more
time?
[Verse
2]
You
had
stopped
and
tilted
your
head
I
still
ponder
what
it
meant
Now,
now,
now,
now,
now,
now
I
tried
searching
faces
on
streets
What
are
the
chances
you'd
be
Downtown,
downtown,
downtown
[Pre-Chorus]
Does
it
feel
alright
to
not
know
me?
I'm
addicted
to
the
"if
only"
[Chorus]
So
I
look
in
people's
windows
Like
I'm
some
deranged
weirdo
I
attend
Christmas
parties
from
outside
I
look
in
people's
windows
In
case
you're
at
their
table
What
if
your
eyes
looked
up
and
met
mine
One
more
time?
