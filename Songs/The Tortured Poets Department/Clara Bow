"You
look
like
Clara
Bow
In
this
light,
remarkable
All
your
life,
did
you
know
You'd
be
picked
like
a
rose?"
"I'm
not
trying
to
exaggerate
But
I
think
I
might
die
if
it
happened
Die
if
it
happened
to
me
No
one
in
my
small
town
Thought
I
would
see
the
lights
of
Manhattan"
"This
town
is
fake,
but
you
are
the
real
thing
Breath
of
fresh
air
through
smoke
rings
Take
the
glory,
give
everything
Promise
to
be
dazzling"
"You
look
like
Stevie
Nicks
In
'75,
the
hair
and
lips
Crowd
goes
wild
at
her
fingertips
Half
moonshine,
a
full
eclipse"
"I'm
not
trying
to
exaggerate
But
I
think
I
might
die
if
I
made
it,
die
if
I
made
it
No
one
in
my
small
town
thought
I
would
meet
these
suits
in
L.A.
They
all
want
to
say..."
"This
town
is
fake,
but
you
are
the
real
thing
Breath
of
fresh
air
through
smoke
rings
Take
the
glory,
give
everything
Promise
to
be
dazzling
The
crown
is
stained,
but
you
are
the
real
queen
Flesh
and
blood
amongst
war
machines
You're
the
new
god
we
are
worshipping
Promise
to
be
dazzling"
Beauty
is
a
beast
that
roars
down
on
all
fours
Demanding
more
Only
when
your
girlish
glow
flickers
just
so
Do
they
let
you
know
It's
hell
on
earth
to
be
heavenly
Them's
the
breaks,
they
do
not
come
gently
"You
look
like
Taylor
Swift
In
this
light,
we
are
lovin'
it
You've
got
edge,
she
never
did
The
future's
bright,
dazzling"
