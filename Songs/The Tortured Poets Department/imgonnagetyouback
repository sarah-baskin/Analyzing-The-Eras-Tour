Yeah
Lilac
short
skirt,
the
one
that
fits
me
like
skin
Did
your
research,
you
knew
the
price
goin'
in
And
I
will
tell
you
one
thing,
honey
I
can
tell
when
somebody
still
wants
me,
come
clean
Standin'
at
the
bar
like
something
is
funny,
bubbly
Once
you
fix
your
face,
I
am
goin'
in
(Yeah)
Whether
I
am
going
to
be
your
wife
or
Gonna
smash
up
your
bike,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
Whether
I
am
going
to
curse
you
out
or
Take
you
back
to
my
house,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
I,
I
hear
the
whispers
in
your
eyes
I
will
make
you
want
to
think
twice
You'll
find
that
you
were
never
not
mine
(You're
mine)
Small
talk,
big
love,
act
like
I
do
not
care
what
you
did
I
am
an
Aston
Martin
that
you
steered
straight
into
the
ditch
Then
ran
and
hid
And
I
will
tell
you
one
thing,
honey
I
can
take
the
upper
hand
and
touch
your
body
Flip
the
script
and
leave
you
like
a
dumb
house
party
Or
I
might
just
love
you
'til
the
end
Whether
I
am
going
to
be
your
wife
or
Gonna
smash
up
your
bike,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
Whether
I
am
going
to
flip
you
off
or
Pull
you
into
the
closet,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
I,
I
hear
the
whispers
in
your
eyes
I
will
make
you
want
to
think
twice
You'll
find
that
you
were
never
not
mine
(You're
mine)
I
can
feel
it
coming,
humming
in
the
way
you
move
Push
the
reset
button,
we
are
becomin'
something
new
Say
you
got
somebody,
I
will
say
I
got
someone
too
Even
if
it
is
handcuffed,
I
am
leavin'
here
with
you
Bygones
will
be
bygone,
eras
fadin'
into
gray
(Fading
into
gray)
We
broke
all
the
pieces,
but
still
want
to
play
the
game
(Oh)
Told
my
friends
I
hate
you,
but
I
love
you
just
the
same
Pick
your
poison,
babe,
I
am
poison
either
way
Whether
I
am
going
to
be
your
wife
or
Gonna
smash
up
your
bike,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
Whether
I
am
going
to
curse
you
out
or
Take
you
back
to
my
house,
I
have
not
decided
yet
But
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
I,
I
hear
the
whispers
in
your
eyes
I
will
make
you
want
to
think
twice
You'll
find
that
you
were
never
not
mine
I
am
going
to
get
you
back
