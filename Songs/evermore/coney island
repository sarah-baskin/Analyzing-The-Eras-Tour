break
my
soul
in
two
looking
for
you
but
you
're
right
here
if
i
ca
n't
relate
to
you
anymore
then
who
am
i
related
to
?
and
if
this
is
the
long
haul
how
'd
we
get
here
so
soon
?
did
i
close
my
fist
around
something
delicate
?
did
i
shatter
you
?
taylor
and
i
'm
sitting
on
a
bench
in
coney
island
wondering
,
where
did
my
baby
go
?
the
fast
times
,
the
bright
lights
,
the
merry
go
sorry
for
not
making
you
my
centerfold
over
and
over
lost
again
with
no
surprises
disappointments
,
close
your
eyes
and
it
gets
colder
and
colder
when
the
sun
goes
down

:
matt
berninger
with
taylor
the
question
pounds
my
head
what
's
a
lifetime
of
achievement
if
i
pushed
you
to
the
edge
but
you
were
too
polite
to
leave
me
?
and
do
you
miss
the
rogue
who
coaxed
you
into
paradise
and
left
you
there
?
will
you
forgive
my
soul
when
you
're
too
wise
to
trust
me
and
too
old
to
care
?
taylor
swift
with
matt
'cause
we
were
like
the
mall
before
the
internet
it
was
the
one
place
to
be
the
mischief
,
the
gift-wrapped
suburban
dreams
sorry
for
not
winning
you
an
arcade
ring
over
and
over
lost
again
with
no
surprises
disappointments
,
close
your
eyes
and
it
gets
colder
and
colder
when
the
sun
goes
down
taylor
swift
,
matt
berninger
,
were
you
waiting
at
our
old
spot
in
the
tree
line
by
the
gold
clock
did
i
leave
you
hanging
every
single
day
?
were
you
standing
in
the
hallway
with
a
big
cake
,
happy
birthday
did
i
paint
your
bluest
skies
the
darkest
grey
?
a
universe
away
and
when
i
got
into
the
accident
the
sight
that
flashed
before
me
was
your
face
but
when
i
walked
up
to
the
podium
i
think
that
i
forgot
to
say
your
name
taylor
swift
&
matt
i
'm
on
