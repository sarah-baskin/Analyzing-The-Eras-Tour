fatefully
i
tried
to
pick
my
battles
'til
the
battle
picked
me
misery
like
the
war
of
words
i
shouted
in
my
sleep
and
you
passed
right
by
i
was
in
the
alley
,
surrounded
on
all
sides
the
knife
cuts
both
ways
if
the
shoe
fits
,
walk
in
it
'til
your
high
heels
break
and
i
fell
from
the
pedestal
right
down
the
rabbit
hole
long
story
short
,
it
was
a
bad
time
pushed
from
the
precipice
clung
to
the
nearest
lips
long
story
short
,
it
was
the
wrong
guy
now
i
'm
all
about
you

'm
all
about
you
,
ah

'm
all
about
you
,
ah
yeah

yeah
actually
i
always
felt
i
must
look
better
in
the
rear
view
missing
me
at
the
golden
gates
they
once
held
the
keys
to
when
i
dropped
my
sword
i
threw
it
in
the
bushes
and
knocked
on
your
door
and
we
live
in
peace
but
if
someone
comes
at
us
,
this
time
,
i
'm
ready
'cause
i
fell
from
the
pedestal
right
down
the
rabbit
hole
long
story
short
,
it
was
a
bad
time
pushed

to
get
lost
in
these
petty
things
your
nemeses
will
defeat
themselves
before
you
get
the
chance
to
swing
and
he
's
passing
by
rare
as
the
glimmer
of
a
comet
in
the
sky
and
he
feels
like
home
if
the
shoe
fits
,
walk
in
it
everywhere
you
go
