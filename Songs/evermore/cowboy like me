And
the
tennis
court
was
covered
up
With
some
tent-like
thing
And
you
asked
me
to
dance
But
I
said,
"Dancin'
is
a
dangerous
game"
Oh,
I
thought
This
is
going
to
be
one
of
those
things
Now
I
know
I
am
never
going
to
love
again
I
have
got
some
tricks
up
my
sleeve
Takes
one
to
know
one
You're
a
cowboy
like
me
Never
wanted
love
Just
a
fancy
car
Now
I
am
waiting
by
the
phone
Like
I
am
sitting
in
an
airport
bar
You
had
some
tricks
up
your
sleeve
Takes
one
to
know
one
You're
a
cowboy
like
me
Perched
in
the
dark
Tellin'
all
the
rich
folks
anything
they
want
to
hear
Like
it
could
be
love
I
could
be
the
way
forward
Only
if
they
pay
for
it
You're
a
bandit
like
me
Eyes
full
of
stars
Hustling
for
the
good
life,
never
thought
I
would
meet
you
here
It
could
be
love
We
could
be
the
way
forward
And
I
know
I
will
pay
for
it
You're
a
cowboy
like
me
Perched
in
the
dark
Tellin'
all
the
rich
folks
anything
they
want
to
hear
Like
it
could
be
love
I
could
be
the
way
forward
Only
if
they
pay
for
it
You're
a
bandit
like
me
Eyes
full
of
stars
Hustlin'
for
the
good
life,
never
thought
I
would
meet
you
here
It
could
be
love
We
could
be
the
way
forward
And
I
know
I
will
pay
for
it
And
the
skeletons
in
both
our
closets
Plotted
hard
to
fuck
this
up
And
the
old
men
that
I
have
swindled
Really
did
believe
I
was
the
one
And
the
ladies
lunchin'
have
their
stories
about
When
you
passed
through
town
Oh,
but
that
was
all
before
I
locked
it
down
Now
you
hang
from
my
lips
Like
the
Gardens
of
Babylon
With
your
boots
beneath
my
bed
Forever
is
the
sweetest
con
I
have
had
some
tricks
up
my
sleeve
Takes
one
to
know
one
You're
a
cowboy
like
me
And
I
am
never
going
to
love
again
I
am
never
going
to
love
again
I
am
never
going
to
love
again
