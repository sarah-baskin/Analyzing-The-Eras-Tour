gleaming
,
twinkling
eyes
like
sinking
ships
on
waters
so
inviting
,
i
almost
jump
in
but
i
do
n't
like
a
gold
rush
,
gold
rush
i
do
n't
like
anticipatin
'
my
face
in
a
red
flush
i
do
n't
like
that
anyone
would
die
to
feel
your
touch
everybody
wants
you
everybody
wonders
what
it
would
be
like
to
love
you
walk
past
,
quick
brush
i
do
n't
like
slow
motion
,
double
vision
in
rose
blush
i
do
n't
like
that
falling
feels
like
flying
'til
the
bone
crush
everybody
wants
you
but
i
do
n't
like
a
gold
rush
what
must
it
be
like
to
grow
up
that
beautiful
?
with
your
hair
falling
into
place
like
dominoes
i
see
me
padding
across
your
wooden
floors
with
my
eagles
t-shirt
hanging
from
the
door
at
dinner
parties
,
i
call
you
out
on
your
contrarian
shit
and
the
coastal
town
we
wandered
'round
had
never
seen
a
love
as
pure
as
it
and
then
it
fades
into
the
gray
of
my
day-old
tea
'cause
it
could
never
be
'cause
i
do
n't
like
a
gold
rush
,

about
you
anymore
at

,
i
wo
