Gleaming,
twinkling
Eyes
like
sinking
Ships
on
waters
So
inviting,
I
almost
jump
in
But
I
do
not
like
a
gold
rush,
gold
rush
I
do
not
like
anticipatin'
my
face
in
a
red
flush
I
do
not
like
that
anyone
would
die
to
feel
your
touch
Everybody
wants
you
Everybody
wonders
what
it
would
be
like
to
love
you
Walk
past,
quick
brush
I
do
not
like
slow
motion,
double
vision
in
rose
blush
I
do
not
like
that
falling
feels
like
flying
'til
the
bone
crush
Everybody
wants
you
But
I
do
not
like
a
gold
rush
What
must
it
be
like
to
grow
up
that
beautiful?
With
your
hair
falling
into
place
like
dominoes
I
see
me
padding
across
your
wooden
floors
With
my
Eagles
T-shirt
hanging
from
the
door
At
dinner
parties,
I
call
you
out
on
your
contrarian
shit
And
the
coastal
town
we
wandered
'round
had
never
seen
a
love
as
pure
as
it
And
then
it
fades
into
the
gray
of
my
day-old
tea
'Cause
it
could
never
be
'Cause
I
do
not
like
a
gold
rush,
gold
rush
I
do
not
like
anticipatin'
my
face
in
a
red
flush
I
do
not
like
that
anyone
would
die
to
feel
your
touch
Everybody
wants
you
Everybody
wonders
what
it
would
be
like
to
love
you
Walk
past,
quick
brush
I
do
not
like
slow
motion,
double
vision
in
rose
blush
I
do
not
like
that
falling
feels
like
flying
'til
the
bone
crush
Everybody
wants
you
But
I
do
not
like
a
gold
rush
What
must
it
be
like
to
grow
up
that
beautiful?
With
your
hair
falling
into
place
like
dominoes
My
mind
turns
your
life
into
folklore
I
cannot
dare
to
dream
about
you
anymore
At
dinner
parties,
I
will
not
call
you
out
on
your
contrarian
shit
And
the
coastal
town
we
never
found
will
never
see
a
love
as
pure
as
it
'Cause
it
fades
into
the
gray
of
my
day-old
tea
'Cause
it
will
never
be
Gleaming,
twinkling
Eyes
like
sinking
Ships
on

So
inviting,
I
