If
I
wanted
to
know
who
you
were
hanging
with
While
I
was
gone,
I
would
have
asked
you
It's
the
kind
of
cold,
fogs
up
windshield
glass
But
I
felt
it
when
I
passed
you
There's
an
ache
in
you,
put
there
by
the
ache
in
me
But
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
It's
the
same
to
me
So
we
could
call
it
even
You
could
call
me
"babe"
for
the
weekend
'Tis
the
damn
season,
write
this
down
I
am
stayin'
at
my
parents'
house
And
the
road
not
taken
looks
real
good
now
And
it
always
leads
to
you
and
my
hometown
I
parked
my
car
right
between
the
Methodist
And
the
school
that
used
to
be
ours
The
holidays
linger
like
bad
perfume
You
can
run,
but
only
so
far
I
escaped
it
too,
remember
how
you
watched
me
leave
But
if
it
is
okay
with
you,
it
is
okay
with
me
We
could
call
it
even
You
could
call
me
"babe"
for
the
weekend
'Tis
the
damn
season,
write
this
down
I
am
stayin'
at
my
parents'
house
And
the
road
not
taken
looks
real
good
now
Time
flies,
messy
as
the
mud
on
your
truck
tires
Now
I
am
missing
your
smile,
hear
me
out
We
could
just
ride
around
And
the
road
not
taken
looks
real
good
now
And
it
always
leads
to
you
and
my
hometown
Sleep
in
half
the
day
just
for
old
times'
sake
I
will
not
ask
you
to
wait
if
you
do
not
ask
me
to
stay
So
I
will
go
back
to
L.A.
and
the
so-called
friends
Who'll
write
books
about
me
if
I
ever
make
it
And
wonder
about
the
only
soul
Who
can
tell
which
smiles
I
am
fakin'
And
the
heart
I
know
I
am
breakin'
is
my
own
To
leave
the
warmest
bed
I
have
ever
known
We
could
call
it
even
Even
though
I
am
leaving
And
I
will
be
yours
for
the
weekend
'Tis
the
damn
season
We
could
call
it
even
You
could
call
me
"babe"
for
the
weekend
'Tis
the
damn
season,
write
this
down
I
am
stayin'
at
my
parents'
house
And
the
road
not
taken
looks
real
good
now
Time
flies,
messy
as
the
mud
on
your
truck
tires
Now
I
am
missing
your
smile,
hear
me
out
We
could
just
ride
around
And
the
road
not
taken
looks
real
good
now
And
it
always
leads
to
you
and
my
hometown
It
always
leads
to
you
and
my
hometown
