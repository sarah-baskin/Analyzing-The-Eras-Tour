honey
,
when
i
'm
above
the
trees
i
see
this
for
what
it
is
but
now
i
'm
right
down
in
it
,
all
the
years
i
've
given
is
just
shit
we
're
dividin
'
up
showed
you
all
of
my
hiding
spots
i
was
dancing
when
the
music
stopped
and
in
the
disbelief
,
i
ca
n't
face
reinvention
i
have
n't
met
the
new
me
yet
there
'll
be
happiness
after
you
but
there
was
happiness
because
of
you
both
of
these
things
can
be
true
there
is
happiness
past
the
blood
and
bruise
past
the
curses
and
cries
beyond
the
terror
in
the
nightfall
haunted
by
the
look
in
my
eyes
that
would
've
loved
you
for
a
lifetime
leave
it
all
behind
and
there
is
happiness
tell
me
,
when
did
your
winning
smile
begin
to
look
like
a
smirk
?
when
did
all
our
lessons
start
to
look
like
weapons
pointed
at
my
deepest
hurt
?
i
hope
she
'll
be
a
beautiful
fool
who
takes
my
spot
next
to
you
no
,
i
did
n't
mean
that
sorry
,
i
ca
n't
see
facts
through
all
of
my
fury
you
have
n't
met
the
new
me
yet
there
'll
be
happiness
after
me
but
there
was
happiness
because
of
me
both
of
these
things
,
i
believe
there
is
happiness
in
our
history
,
across
our
great
divide
there
is
a
glorious
sunrise
dappled
with
the
flickers
of
light
from
the
dress
i
wore
at
midnight
,
leave
it
all
behind
and
there
is
happiness
i
ca
n't
make
it
go
away
by
making
you
a
villain
i
guess
it
's
the
price
i
paid
for
seven
years
in
heaven
and
i
pulled
your
body
into
mine
every
goddamn
night
,
now
i
get
fake
niceties
no
one
teaches
you
what
to
do
when
a
good
man
hurts
you
and
you
know
you
hurt
him
too
honey
,
when
i
'm
above
the
trees
i
see
it
for
what
it
is
but
now
my
eyes
leak
acid
rain
on
the
pillow
where
you
used
to
lay
your
head
after
giving
you
the
best
i
had
tell
me
what
to
give
after
that
all
you
want
from
me
now
is
the
green
light
of
forgiveness
you
have
n't
met
the
new
me
yet
and
i
think
she
'll
give
you
that
there
'll
be
happiness
after
you
but
there
was
happiness
because
of
you
too
both
of
these
things
can
be
true
there
is
happiness
in
our
history
,
across
our
great
divide
there
is
a
glorious
sunrise
dappled
with
the
flickers
of
light
from
the
dress
i
wore
at
midnight
,
leave
it
all
behind
oh
,
leave
it
all
behind
leave
it
all
behind
and
there
is
happiness
