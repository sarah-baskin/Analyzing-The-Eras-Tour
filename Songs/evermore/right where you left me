Friends
break
up,
friends
get
married
Strangers
get
born,
strangers
get
buried
Trends
change,
rumors
fly
through
new
skies
But
I
am
right
where
you
left
me
Matches
burn
after
the
other
Pages
turn
and
stick
to
each
other
Wages
earned
and
lessons
learned
But
I,
I
am
right
where
you
left
me
Help,
I
am
still
at
the
restaurant
Still
sitting
in
a
corner
I
haunt
Cross-legged
in
the
dim
light
They
say,
"What
a
sad
sight,"
I
I
swear
you
could
hear
a
hair
pin
drop
Right
when
I
felt
the
moment
stop
Glass
shattered
on
the
white
cloth
Everybody
moved
on,
I,
I
stayed
there
Dust
collected
on
my
pinned-up
hair
They
expected
me
to
find
somewhere
Some
perspective,
but
I
sat
and
stared
right
where
You
left
me,
you
left
me
no,
oh,
you
left
me
no
You
left
me
no
choice
but
to
stay
here
forever
You
left
me,
you
left
me
no,
oh,
you
left
me
no
You
left
me
no
choice
but
to
stay
here
forever
Did
you
ever
hear
about
the
girl
who
got
frozen?
Time
went
on
for
everybody
else,
she
will
not
know
it
She's
still
twenty-three
inside
her
fantasy
How
it
was
supposed
to
be
Did
you
hear
about
the
girl
who
lives
in
delusion?
Breakups
happen
every
day,
you
do
not
have
to
lose
it
She's
still
twenty-three
inside
her
fantasy
And
you
are
sitting
in
front
of
me
At
the
restaurant
When
I
was
still
the
one
you
want
Cross-legged
in
the
dim
light
Everything
was
just
right,
I
I
could
feel
the
mascara
run
You
told
me
that
you
met
someone
Glass
shattered
on
the
white
cloth
Everybody
moved
on
Help,
I
am
still
at
the
restaurant
Still
sitting
in
a
corner
I
haunt
Cross-legged
in
the
dim
light
They
say,
"What
a
sad
sight,"
I,
I
stayed
there
Dust
collected
on
my
pinned-up
hair
I
am
sure
that
you
got
a
wife
out
there
Kids
and
Christmas,
but
I
am
unaware
because
I
am
right
where
I
cause
no
harm,
mind
my
business
If
our
love
died
young,
I
cannot
bear
witness,
and
it
is
been
so
long
If
you
ever
think
you
got
it
wrong,
I
am
right
where
You
left
me,
you
left
me
no,
oh,
you
left
me
no
You
left
me
no
choice
but
to
stay
here
forever
You
left
me,
you
left
me
no,
oh,
you
left
me
no
You
left
me
no
choice
but
to
stay
here
forever
