When
the
dinner
is
cold
and
the
chatter
gets
old
You
ask
for
the
tab
Or
that
moment
again,
he's
insisting
that
friends
Look
at
each
other
like
that
When
the
words
of
a
sister
come
back
in
whispers
That
prove
she
was
not
In
fact
what
she
seemed,
not
a
twin
from
your
dreams
She's
a
crook
who
was
caught
[Chorus]
That
old
familiar
body
ache
The
snaps
from
the
same
little
breaks
in
your
soul
You
know
when
it's
time
to
go
[Verse
2]
Twenty
years
at
your
job,
then
the
son
of
the
boss
Gets
the
spot
that
was
yours
Or
trying
to
stay
for
the
kids,
when
keeping
it
how
it
is
Will
only
break
their
hearts
worse
[Chorus]
That
old
familiar
body
ache
The
snaps
from
the
same
little
breaks
in
your
soul
You
know
when
it's
time
to
go
[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes,
givin'
up
is
the
strong
thing
Sometimes,
to
run
is
the
brave
thing
Sometimes,
walkin'
out
is
the
one
thing
That
will
find
you
the
right
thing
Sometimes,
givin'
up
is
the
strong
thing
Sometimes,
to
run
is
the
brave
thing
Sometimes,
walkin'
out
is
the
one
thing
That
will
find
you
the
right
thing
[Verse
3]
Fifteen
years,
fifteen
million
tears
Begging
'til
my
knees
bled
I
gave
it
my
all,
he
gave
me
nothin'
at
all
Then
wondered
why
I
left
Now
he
sits
on
his
throne
in
his
palace
of
bones
Praying
to
his
greed
He's
got
my
past
frozen
behind
glass
But
I've
got
me
[Chorus]
That
old
familiar
body
ache
The
snaps
from
the
same
little
breaks
in
my
soul
I
know
when
it's
time
to
go
[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes,
givin'
up
is
the
strong
thing
Sometimes,
to
run
is
the
brave
thing
Sometimes,
walkin'
out
is
the
one
thing
That
will
find
you
the
right
thing
Sometimes,
givin'
up
is
the
strong
thing
Sometimes,
to
run
is
the
brave
thing
Sometimes,
walkin'
out
is
the
one
thing
That
will
find
you
the
right
thing
[Outro]
That
will
find
you
the
right
thing
And
you
know
in
your
soul
And
you
know
in
your
soul
When
it's
time
to
go
And,
well,
you
know,
you
know,
you
know,
you
know
When
it's
time
to
go
So
then
you
go
and
then
you
go
You
just
go
