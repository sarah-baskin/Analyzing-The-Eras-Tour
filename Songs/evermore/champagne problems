You
booked
the
night
train
for
a
reason
So
you
could
sit
there
in
this
hurt
Bustling
crowds
or
silent
sleepers
You're
not
sure
which
is
worse
Because
I
dropped
your
hand
while
dancing
Left
you
out
there
standing
Crestfallen
on
the
landing
Champagne
problems
Your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
My
picture
in
your
wallet
Your
heart
was
glass,
I
dropped
it
Champagne
problems
You
told
your
family
for
a
reason
You
could
not
keep
it
in
Your
sister
splashed
out
on
the
bottle
Now
no
one's
celebrating
Dom
PÃ©rignon,
you
brought
it
No
crowd
of
friends
applauded
Your
hometown
skeptics
called
it
Champagne
problems
You
had
a
speech,
you
are
speechless
Love
slipped
beyond
your
reaches
And
I
could
not
give
a
reason
Champagne
problems
Your
Midas
touch
on
the
Chevy
door
November
flush
and
your
flannel
cure
"This
dorm
was
once
a
madhouse"
I
made
a
joke,
"Well,
it
is
made
for
me"
How
evergreen,
our
group
of
friends
Don't
think
we
will
say
that
word
again
And
soon
they
will
have
the
nerve
to
deck
the
halls
That
we
once
walked
through
One
for
the
money,
two
for
the
show
I
never
was
ready
so
I
watch
you
go
Sometimes
you
just
do
not
know
the
answer
'Til
someone
is
on
their
knees
and
asks
you
"She
would
have
made
such
a
lovely
bride
What
a
shame
she
is
fucked
in
the
head,"
they
said
But
you
will
find
the
real
thing
instead
She'll
patch
up
your
tapestry
that
I
shred
And
hold
your
hand
while
dancing
Never
leave
you
standing
Crestfallen
on
the
landing
With
champagne
problems
Your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
Her
picture
in
your
wallet
You
will
not
remember
all
my
Champagne
problems
You
will
not
remember
all
my
Champagne
problems
