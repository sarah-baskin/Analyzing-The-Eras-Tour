How's
one
to
know?
I
would
meet
you
where
the
spirit
meets
the
bones
In
a
faith-forgotten
land
In
from
the
snow
Your
touch
brought
forth
an
incandescent
glow
Tarnished
but
so
grand
And
the
old
widow
goes
to
the
stone
every
day
But
I
don't,
I
just
sit
here
and
wait
Grieving
for
the
living
Oh,
goddamn
My
pain
fits
in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
Taking
mine,
but
it
is
been
promised
to
another
Oh,
I
cannot
Stop
you
putting
roots
in
my
dreamland
My
house
of
stone,
your
ivy
grows
And
now
I
am
covered
in
you
I
wish
to
know
The
fatal
flaw
that
makes
you
long
to
be
Magnificently
cursed
He's
in
the
room
Your
opal
eyes
are
all
I
wish
to
see
He
wants
what
is
only
yours
Oh,
goddamn
My
pain
fits
in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
Taking
mine,
but
it
is
been
promised
to
another
Oh,
I
cannot
Stop
you
putting
roots
in
my
dreamland
My
house
of
stone,
your
ivy
grows
And
now
I
am
covered
Clover
blooms
in
the
fields
Spring
breaks
loose,
the
time
is
near
What
would
he
do
if
he
found
us
out?
Crescent
moon,
coast
is
clear
Spring
breaks
loose,
but
so
does
fear
He's
going
to
burn
this
house
to
the
ground
How's
one
to
know?
I
would
live
and
die
for
moments
that
we
stole
On
begged
and
borrowed
time
So
tell
me
to
run
Or
dare
to
sit
and
watch
what
we
will
become
And
drink
my
husband's
wine
Oh,
goddamn
My
pain
fits
in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
Taking
mine,
but
it
is
been
promised
to
another
Oh,
I
cannot
Stop
you
putting
roots
in
my
dreamland
My
house
of
stone,
your
ivy
grows
And
now
I
am
covered
in
you
And
I
am
covered
in
you
So
yeah,
it
is
a
fire
It's
a
goddamn
blaze
in
the
dark
And
you
started
it
You
started
it
So
yeah,
it
is
a
war
It's
the
goddamn
fight
of
my
life
And
you
started
it
You
started
it
Oh,
I
cannot
Stop
you
putting
roots
in
my
dreamland
My
house
of
stone,
your
ivy
grows
And
now
I
am
covered
In
you,
in
you
Now
I
am
covered
in
you
In
you
