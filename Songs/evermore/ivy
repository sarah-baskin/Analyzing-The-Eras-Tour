the
spirit
meets
the
bones
in

faith-forgotten
land

from

touch
brought
forth
an
incandescent
glow
tarnished

so
grand
and
the
old
widow
goes
to
the
stone
every
day

just
sit
here
and
wait
grieving
for
the
living

pain
fits
in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
taking
mine

promised
to
another

ivy
grows
and

the
fatal
flaw
that
makes
you
long
to
be
magnificently
cursed

in
the
room

opal
eyes

wish
to
see

pain

in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
