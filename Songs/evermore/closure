It's
been
a
long
time
And
seeing
the
shape
of
your
name
Still
spells
out
pain
It
was
not
right
The
way
it
all
went
down
Looks
like
you
know
that
now
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
It
cut
deep
to
know
ya,
right
to
the
bone
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
I
know
that
it
is
over,
I
do
not
need
your
Closure,
your
closure
Don't
treat
me
like
Some
situation
that
needs
to
be
handled
I
am
fine
with
my
spite
And
my
tears
and
my
beers
and
my
candles
I
can
feel
you
smoothing
me
over
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
It
cut
deep
to
know
ya,
right
to
the
bone
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
I
know
that
it
is
over,
I
do
not
need
your
Closure,
your
closure
Your
closure,
your
closure
I
know
I
am
just
a
wrinkle
in
your
new
life
Staying
friends
would
iron
it
out
so
nice
Guilty,
guilty,
reaching
out
across
the
sea
That
you
put
between
you
and
me
But
it
is
fake
and
it
is
oh-so
unnecessary
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
It
cut
deep
to
know
ya,
right
to
the
bone
Yes,
I
got
your
letter
Yes,
I
am
doing
better
I
know
that
it
is
over,
I
do
not
need
your
Closure,
closure,
your
closure
Your
closure
