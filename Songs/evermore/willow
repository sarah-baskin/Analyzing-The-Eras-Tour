i
'm
like
the
water
when
your
ship
rolled
in
that
night
rough
on
the
surface
,
but
you
cut
through
like
a
knife
and
if
it
was
an
open-shut
case
i
never
would
've
known
from
that
look
on
your
face
lost
in
your
current
like
a
priceless
wine
the
more
that
you
say
,
the
less
i
know
wherever
you
stray
,
i
follow
i
'm
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
wreck
my
plans
,
that
's
my
man
life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
head
on
the
pillow
,
i
could
feel
you
sneakin
'
in
as
if
you
were
a
mythical
thing
like
you
were
a
trophy
or
a
champion
ring
and
there
was
one
prize
i
'd
cheat
to
win
the
more
that
you
say
,
the
less
i
know
wherever
you
stray
,
i
follow
i
'm
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
wreck
my
plans
,
that
's
my
man
you
know
that
my
train
could
take
you
home
anywhere
else
is
hollow
i
'm
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
wreck
my
plans
,
that
's
my
man
life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
they
count
me
out
time
and
time
again
life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
but
i
come
back
stronger
than
a
'90s
trend
wait
for
the
signal
,
and
i
'll
meet
you
after
dark
show
me
the
places
where
the
others
gave
you
scars
now
this
is
an
open-shut
case
i
guess
i
should
've
known
from
the
look
on
your
face
every
bait-and-switch
was
a
work
of
art
the
more
that
you
say
,
the
less
i
know
wherever
you
stray
,
i
follow
i
'm
begging
for
you
to
take
my
