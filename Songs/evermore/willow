I
am
like
the
water
when
your
ship
rolled
in
that
night
Rough
on
the
surface,
but
you
cut
through
like
a
knife
And
if
it
was
an
open-shut
case
I
never
would
have
known
from
that
look
on
your
face
Lost
in
your
current
like
a
priceless
wine
The
more
that
you
say,
the
less
I
know
Wherever
you
stray,
I
follow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
Life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
Head
on
the
pillow,
I
could
feel
you
sneakin'
in
As
if
you
were
a
mythical
thing
Like
you
were
a
trophy
or
a
champion
ring
And
there
was
one
prize
I
would
cheat
to
win
The
more
that
you
say,
the
less
I
know
Wherever
you
stray,
I
follow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
You
know
that
my
train
could
take
you
home
Anywhere
else
is
hollow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
Life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
They
count
me
out
time
and
time
again
Life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
But
I
come
back
stronger
than
a
'90s
trend
Wait
for
the
signal,
and
I
will
meet
you
after
dark
Show
me
the
places
where
the
others
gave
you
scars
Now
this
is
an
open-shut
case
I
guess
I
should
have
known
from
the
look
on
your
face
Every
bait-and-switch
was
a
work
of
art
The
more
that
you
say,
the
less
I
know
Wherever
you
stray,
I
follow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
You
know
that
my
train
could
take
you
home
Anywhere
else
is
hollow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
The
more
that
you
say,
the
less
I
know
Wherever
you
stray,
I
follow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
You
know
that
my
train
could
take
you
home
Anywhere
else
is
hollow
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
Hey,
that
is
my
man
That's
my
man
Yeah,
that
is
my
man
Every
bait-and-switch
was
a
work
of
art
That's
my
man
Hey,
that
is
my
man
I
am
begging
for
you
to
take
my
hand
Wreck
my
plans,
that
is
my
man
