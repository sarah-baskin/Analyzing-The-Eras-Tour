been
down
since
july
motion
capture
put
me
in
a
bad
light
i
replay
my
footsteps
on
each
stepping
stone
trying
to
find
the
one
where
i
went
wrong
writing
letters
addressed
to
the
fire
taylor
and
i
was
catchin
'
my
breath
starin
'
out
an
open
window
,
catchin
'
my
death
and
i
could
n't
be
sure
i
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar
that
this
pain
would
be
for
evermore

taylor
hey
,
december
guess
i
'm
feeling
unmoored
ca
n't
remember
what
i
used
to
fight
for
i
rewind
the
tape
,
but
all
it
does
is
pause
on
the
very
moment
all
was
lost
sending
signals
to
be
double-crossed
taylor
and
i
was
catchin
'
my
breath
barefoot
in
the
wildest
winter
,
catchin
'
my
death
and
i
could
n't
be
sure
i
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar
that
this
pain
would
be
for
evermore

taylor
ca
n't
not
think
of
all
the
cost
and
the
things
that
will
be
lost
oh
,
can
we
just
get
a
pause
?
to
be
certain
we
'll
be
tall
again
whether
weather
be
the
frost
or
the
violence
of
the
dog
days
i
'm
on
waves
,
out
being
tossed
is
there
a
line
that
i
could
just
go
cross
?
and
when
i
was
shipwrecked
(
ca
n't
think
of
all
the
cost
now
)
i
thought
of
you
(
all
the
things
that
will
be
lost
now
)
in
the
cracks
of
light
(
can
we
just
get
a
pause
?
)
i
dreamed
of
you
(
to
be
certain
we
'll
be
tall
again
)
(
if
you
think
of
all
the
cost
)
it
was
real
enough
(
whether
weather
be
the
frost
)
to
get
me
through
(
or
the
violence
of
the
dog
days
)
(

violence

(
out
on

'm
on

i
swear
(
is
there
a
line
that
we
can
just
go
cross

were
there

justin
and
i
was
catchin
'
my
breath
floors
of
a
cabin
creakin
'
under
my
step

i
could
n't
be
sure
i
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar

pain
would
n't
