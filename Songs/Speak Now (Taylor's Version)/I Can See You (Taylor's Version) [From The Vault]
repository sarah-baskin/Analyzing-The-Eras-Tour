I-I-I-I
You
brush
past
me
in
the
hallway
And
you
do
not
think
I,
I,
I
can
see
ya,
do
ya?
I
have
been
watchin'
you
for
ages
And
I
spend
my
time
tryin'
not
to
feel
it
But
what
would
you
do
if
I
went
to
touch
you
now?
What
would
you
do
if
they
never
found
us
out?
What
would
you
do
if
we
never
made
a
sound?
'Cause
I
can
see
you
waitin'
down
the
hall
from
me
And
I
could
see
you
up
against
the
wall
with
me
And
what
would
you
do?
Baby,
if
you
only
knew
That
I
can
see
you
I-I-I-I
And
we
kept
everything
professional
But
something
is
changed,
it
is
somethin'
I,
I
like
They
keep
watchful
eyes
on
us
So
it
is
best
that
we
move
fast
and
keep
quiet
You
will
not
believe
half
the
things
I
see
inside
my
head
Wait
'til
you
see
half
the
things
that
have
not
happened
yet
But
what
would
you
do
if
I
went
to
touch
you
now?
What
would
you
do
if
they
never
found
us
out?
What
would
you
do
if
we
never
made
a
sound?
'Cause
I
can
see
you
waitin'
down
the
hall
from
me
And
I
could
see
you
up
against
the
wall
with
me
And
what
would
you
do?
Baby,
if
you
only
knew,
oh,
oh,
oh
That
I
could
see
you
throw
your
jacket
on
the
floor
I
could
see
you,
make
me
want
you
even
more
What
would
you
do?
Baby,
if
you
only
knew
That
I
can
see
you
I-I-I-I
I
can
see
you
in
your
suit
and
your
necktie
Passed
me
a
note
sayin',
"Meet
me
tonight"
Then
we
kiss
and
you
know
I
will
not
ever
tell,
yeah
And
I
could
see
you
being
my
addiction
You
can
see
me
as
a
secret
mission
Hide
away
and
I
will
start
behaving
myself
I-I-I-I
Oh-oh,
oh,
oh
I
can
see
you
waitin'
down
the
hall
from
me
And
I
could
see
you
up
against
the
wall
with
me
And
what
would
you
do?
Baby,
if
you
only
knew,
oh
That
I
could
see
you
throw
your
jacket
on
the
floor
I
could
see
you,
make
me
want
you
even
more
What
would
you
do?
Baby,
if
you
only
knew
That
I
can
see
you,
oh,
I
can
see
you
Oh,
I
see
you,
I
see
you,
baby
I
see
you
(I-I-I-I)
I
see
you,
I
see
you,
baby
Oh,
baby
