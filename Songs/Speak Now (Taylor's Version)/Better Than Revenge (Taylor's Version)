Now
go
stand
in
the
corner
and
think
about
what
you
did
(Ha)
Haha,
time
for
a
little
revenge
The
story
starts
when
it
was
hot
and
it
was
summer,
and
I
had
it
all,
I
had
him
right
there
where
I
wanted
him
She
came
along,
got
him
alone,
and
let
us
hear
the
applause
She
took
him
faster
than
you
can
say
"Sabotage"
I
never
saw
it
coming,
would
not
have
suspected
it
I
underestimated
just
who
I
was
dealing
with
(Oh)
She
had
to
know
the
pain
was
beating
on
me
like
a
drum
She
underestimated
just
who
she
was
stealin'
from
She's
not
a
saint
and
she
is
not
what
you
think
She's
an
actress,
woah
He
was
a
moth
to
the
flame
She
was
holding
the
matches,
woah
Soon,
she
is
going
to
find
stealing
other
people's
toys
On
the
playground
will
not
make
you
many
friends
She
should
keep
in
mind,
she
should
keep
in
mind
There
is
nothing
I
do
better
than
revenge
(Revenge),
ha
She
looks
at
life
like
it
is
a
party
and
she
is
on
the
list
She
looks
at
me
like
I
am
a
trend
and
she
is
so
over
it
I
think
her
ever-present
frown
is
a
little
troubling,
and
She
thinks
I
am
psycho
because
I
like
to
rhyme
her
name
with
things
But
sophistication
is
not
what
you
wear
or
who
you
know
Or
pushing
people
down
to
get
you
where
you
want
to
go
They
did
not
teach
you
that
in
prep
school
so
it
is
up
to
me
That
no
amount
of
vintage
dresses
gives
you
dignity
(Think
about
what
you
did)
She's
not
a
saint
and
she
is
not
what
you
think
She's
an
actress,
woah
He
was
a
moth
to
the
flame
She
was
holding
the
matches,
woah
Soon,
she
is
going
to
find
stealing
other
people's
toys
On
the
playground
will
not
make
you
many
friends
She
should
keep
in
mind,
she
should
keep
in
mind
There
is
nothing
I
do
better
than
revenge
(Haha)
I
am
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at,
honey
You
might
have
him,
but
have
not
you
heard?
I
am
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at,
honey
You
might
have
him,
but
I
always
get
the
last
word
Woah
(Come
on,
can
you
take
it
back?
Come
on)
She's
not
a
saint
and
she
is
not
what
you
think
(No)
She's
an
actress,
woah
(You
know
that
you
deserve
this)
He
was
a
moth
to
the
flame
She
was
holding
the
matches,
woah
Soon,
she
is
going
to

keep
in
mind,
she
should
keep
in
mind
There
is
nothing
I
do
better
than
revenge
(Come
on)
Do
you
still
feel
like
you
know
what
you
are
doin'?
'Cause
I
do
not
think
you
do,
oh
(No,
no,
no,
no)
Do
you
still
feel
like
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
(No)
I
do
not
think
you
do,
I
do
not
think
you
do
Let's
hear
the
applause
(Come
on,
come
on)
Come
on,
show
me
how
much
better
you
are
(Oh,
oh)
(So
much
better,
yeah?)
So
you
deserve
some
applause
'Cause
you
are
so
much
better
She
took
him
faster
than
you
could
say
"Sabotage"
