now
go
stand
in
the
corner
and
think
about
what
you
did
(
ha
)
haha
,
time
for
a
little
revenge
the
story
starts
when
it
was
hot
and
it
was
summer
,
and
i
had
it
all
,
i
had
him
right
there
where
i
wanted
him
she
came
along
,
got
him
alone
,
and
let
's
hear
the
applause
she
took
him
faster
than
you
can
say
``
sabotage
''
i
never
saw
it
coming
,
would
n't
have
suspected
it
i
underestimated
just
who
i
was
dealing
with
(
oh
)
she
had
to
know
the
pain
was
beating
on
me
like
a
drum
she
underestimated
just
who
she
was
stealin
'
from
she
's
not
a
saint
and
she
's
not
what
you
think
she
's
an
actress
,
woah
he
was
a
moth
to
the
flame
she
was
holding
the
matches
,
woah
soon
,
she
's
gon
na
find
stealing
other
people
's
toys
on
the
playground
wo
n't
make
you
many
friends
she
should
keep
in
mind
,
she
should
keep
in
mind
there
is
nothing
i
do
better
than
revenge
(
revenge
)
,
ha
she
looks
at
life
like
it
's
a
party
and
she
's
on
the
list
she
looks
at
me
like
i
'm
a
trend
and
she
's
so
over
it
i
think
her
ever-present
frown
is
a
little
troubling
,
and
she
thinks
i
'm
psycho
'cause
i
like
to
rhyme
her
name
with
things
but
sophistication
is
n't
what
you
wear
or
who
you
know
or
pushing
people
down
to
get
you
where
you
wan
na
go
they
did
n't
teach
you
that
in
prep
school
so
it
's
up
to
me
that
no
amount
of
vintage
dresses
gives
you
dignity
(
think
about
what
you
did
)
she
's
not
a
saint
and
she
's
not
what
you
think
she
's
an
actress

your
eyes
at
