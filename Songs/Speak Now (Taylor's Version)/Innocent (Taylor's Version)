easier
in

believed
in
everything
and
everybody
believed
in
you
?
it
's
alright
,

your
string
of
lights
are
still
bright
to

it
all
again
you
would
n't
be
shattered
on
the
floor
now
if
only
you
had
seen
what
you
know
now
then
was
n't
it
easier
in
your
firefly-catching
days
?
when
everything
out
of
reach
someone
bigger
brought
down
to
you
was
n't
it
beautiful
running
wild
'til
you
fell
asleep
before
the
monsters
caught
up
to
you
?
it
's
alright
,
just
wait
and
see
your
string
of
