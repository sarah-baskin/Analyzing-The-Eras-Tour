My
cards
are
on
the
table,
yours
are
in
your
hand
Chances
are,
tonight,
you
have
already
got
plans
And
chances
are
I
will
talk
myself
to
sleep
again
You
give
me
just
enough
attention
to
keep
my
hopes
too
high
Wishful
thoughts
forget
to
mention
when
something
is
really
not
right
And
I
will
block
out
these
voices
of
reason
in
my
head
And
the
voices
say,
"You
are
not
the
exception
You
will
never
learn
your
lesson"
Foolish
one
Stop
checkin'
your
mailbox
for
confessions
of
love
That
are
not
never
going
to
come
You
will
take
the
long
way,
you
will
take
the
long
way
down
You
know
how
to
keep
me
waitin'
I
know
how
to
act
like
I
am
fine
Don't
know
what
to
call
this
situation
But
I
know
I
cannot
call
you
mine
And
it
is
delicate,
but
I
will
do
my
best
to
seem
bulletproof
'Cause
when
my
head
is
on
your
shoulder
It
starts
thinkin'
you
will
come
around
And
maybe,
someday,
when
we
are
older
This
is
something
we
will
laugh
about
Over
coffee
every
mornin'
while
you
are
watching
the
news
But
then
the
voices
say,
"You
are
not
the
exception
You
will
never
learn
your
lesson"
Foolish
one
Stop
checkin'
your
mailbox
for
confessions
of
love
That
are
not
never
going
to
come
You
will
take
the
long
way,
you
will
take
the
long
way
down
Foolish
one
Stop
checkin'
your
mailbox
for
confessions
of
love
That
are
not
never
going
to
come
You
will
learn
the
hard
way
instead
of
just
walkin'
out
Now
I
am
slidin'
down
the
wall
with
my
head
in
my
hands
Sayin',
"How
could
I
not
see
the
signs?"
Oh,
you
have
not
written
me
or
called
But
goodbye
screamin'
in
the
silence
And
the
voices
in
my
head
are
tellin'
me
why
'Cause
you
got
her
on
your
arm
and
me
in
the
wings
I
will
get
your
longing
glances,
but
she
will
get
your
ring
And
you
will
say
you
had
the
best
of
intentions
And
maybe
I
will
finally
learn
my
lesson
Foolish
one
Stop
checkin'
your
mailbox
for
confessions
of
love
That
are
not
never
going
to
come
You
will
take
the
long
way,
you
will
take
the
long
way
down
Foolish
one
Stop
checkin'
your
mailbox
for
confessions
of
love
That
are
not
never
going
to
come
You
will
learn
the
hard
way
instead
of
just
walkin'
out,
oh-oh,
oh,
oh
La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la,
oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't
never
going
to
come
Ooh,
you
will
learn
the
hard
way
now
Foolish
one
Sittin'
'round
waiting
for
confessions
of
love
They
are
not
never
going
to
come
And
thinkin'
he
is
the
one,
you
should
have
been
walkin'
out
Foolish
one
The
day
is
going
to
come
for
your
confessions
of
love
When
all
is
said
and
done,
he
just
was
not
the
one
No,
he
just
was
not
the
one
