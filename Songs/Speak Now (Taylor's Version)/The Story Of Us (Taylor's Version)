I
used
to
think
one
day
we
would
tell
the
story
of
us
How
we
met
and
the
sparks
flew
instantly
And
people
would
say,
"They're
the
lucky
ones"
I
used
to
know
my
place
was
the
spot
next
to
you
Now
I
am
searchin'
the
room
for
an
empty
seat
'Cause
lately
I
do
not
even
know
what
page
you
are
on
Oh,
a
simple
complication
Miscommunications
lead
to
fallout
So
many
things
that
I
wish
you
knew
So
many
walls
up,
I
cannot
break
through
Now
I
am
standin'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
And
we
are
not
speakin'
And
I
am
dyin'
to
know,
is
it
killin'
you
Like
it
is
killin'
me?
Yeah
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
When
it
all
broke
down
And
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
Next
chapter
How'd
we
end
up
this
way?
See
me
nervously
pulling
at
my
clothes
and
tryin'
to
look
busy
And
you
are
doin'
your
best
to
avoid
me
I
am
starting
to
think
one
day
I
will
tell
the
story
of
us
How
I
was
losin'
my
mind
when
I
saw
you
here
But
you
held
your
pride
like
you
should
have
held
me
Oh,
I
am
scared
to
see
the
ending
Why
are
we
pretending
this
is
nothin'?
I
would
tell
you
I
miss
you,
but
I
do
not
know
how
I
have
never
heard
silence
quite
this
loud
Now
I
am
standin'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
And
we
are
not
speakin'
And
I
am
dyin'
to
know,
is
it
killin'
you
Like
it
is
killin'
me?
Yeah
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
When
it
all
broke
down
And
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
This
is
looking
like
a
contest
Of
who
can
act
like
they
care
less
But
I
liked
it
better
when
you
were
on
my
side
The
battle's
in
your
hands
now
But
I
would
lay
my
armor
down
If
you
said
you
would
rather
love
than
fight
So
many
things
that
you
wish
I
knew
But
the
story
of
us
might
be
ending
soon
Now
I
am
standin'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
And
we
are
not
speakin'
And
I
am
dyin'
to
know,
is
it
killin'
you
Like
it
is
killin'
me?
Yeah
And
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
When
it
all
broke
down
And
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now,
now,
now
And
we
are
not
speakin'
And
I
am
dyin'
to
know,
is
it
killin'
you
Like
it
is
killin'
me?
Yeah
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
'Cause
we
are
goin'
down
And
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
The
end
