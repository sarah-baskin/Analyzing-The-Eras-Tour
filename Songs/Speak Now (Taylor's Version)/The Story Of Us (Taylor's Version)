i
used
to
think
one
day
we
'd
tell
the
story
of
us
how
we
met
and
the
sparks
flew
instantly
and
people
would
say
,
``
they
're
the
lucky
ones
''
i
used
to
know
my
place
was
the
spot
next
to
you
now
i
'm
searchin
'
the
room
for
an
empty
seat
'cause
lately
i
do
n't
even
know
what
page
you
're
on
oh
,
a
simple
complication
miscommunications
lead
to
fallout
so
many
things
that
i
wish
you
knew
so
many
walls
up
,
i
ca
n't
break
through
now
i
'm
standin
'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
and
we
're
not
speakin
'
and
i
'm
dyin
'
to
know
,
is
it
killin
'
you
like
it
's
killin
'
me
?
yeah
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
when
it
all
broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
next
chapter
how
'd
we
end
up
this
way
?
see
me
nervously
pulling
at
my
clothes
and
tryin
'
to
look
busy
and
you
're
doin
'
your
best
to
avoid
me
i
'm
starting
to
think
one
day
i
'll
tell
the
story
of
us
how
i
was
losin
'
my
mind
when
i
saw
you
here
but
you
held
your
pride
like
you
should
've
held
me
oh
,
i
'm
scared
to
see
the
ending
why
are
we
pretending
this
is
nothin
'
?
i
'd
tell
you
i
miss
you
,
but
i
do
n't
know
how
i
've
never
heard
silence
quite
this
loud
now
i
'm
standin
'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
and
we
're
not
speakin
'
and
i
'm
dyin
'
to
know
,
is
it
killin
'
you
like
it
's
killin
'
me
?
yeah
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
when
it
all
broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
this
is
looking
like
a
contest
of
who
can
act
like
they
care
less
but
i
liked
it
better
when
you
were
on
my
side
the
battle
's
in
your
hands
now
but
i
would
lay
my
armor
down
if
you
said
you
'd
rather
love
than
fight
so
many
things
that
you
wish
i
knew
but
the
story
of
us
might
be
ending
soon
now
i
'm
standin
'
alone
in
a
crowded
room
and
we
're
not
speakin
'
and
i
'm
dyin
'
to
know
,
is
it
killin
'
you
like
it
's
killin
'
me
?
yeah
and
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
when
it
all
broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now

're
not
speakin
'
and

like
it
's
killin
'
me
?

story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
