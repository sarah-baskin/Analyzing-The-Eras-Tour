you
and
i
walk
a
fragile
line
i
have
known
it
all
this
time
but
i
never
thought
i
'd
live
to
see
it
break
it
's
getting
dark
and
it
's
all
so
quiet
and
i
ca
n't
trust
anything
now
and
it
's
coming
over
you
like
it
's
all
a
big
mistake

my
breath
wo
n't
lose
you
again
something
's
made
your
eyes
go
cold
come
on
,
come
on
,
do
n't
leave
me
like
this
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
something
's
gone
terribly
wrong
you
're
all
i
wanted
come
on
,
come
on
,
do
n't
leave
me
like
this
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
ca
n't
breathe
whenever
you
're
gone
ca
n't
turn
back
now
,
i
'm
haunted
stood
there
and
watched
you
walk
away
from
everything
we
had
but
i
still
mean
every
word
i
said
to
you
he
will
try
to
take
away
my
pain
and
he
just
might
make
me
smile
but
the
whole
time
,
i
'm
wishing
he
was
you
instead
oh
,
holding
my
breath
wo
n't
see
you
again
something
keeps
me
holding
onto
nothing
come
on
,
come
on
,
do
n't
leave
me
like
this
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
something
's
gone
terribly
wrong
you
're
all
i
wanted
come
on
,
come
on
,
