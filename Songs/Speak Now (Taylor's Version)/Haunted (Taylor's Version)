You
and
I
walk
a
fragile
line
I
have
known
it
all
this
time
But
I
never
thought
I
would
live
to
see
it
break
It's
getting
dark
and
it
is
all
so
quiet
And
I
cannot
trust
anything
now
And
it
is
coming
over
you
like
it
is
all
a
big
mistake
Oh,
holding
my
breath
Won't
lose
you
again
Something's
made
your
eyes
go
cold
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Something's
gone
terribly
wrong
You're
all
I
wanted
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Can't
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
Can't
turn
back
now,
I
am
haunted
Stood
there
and
watched
you
walk
away
From
everything
we
had
But
I
still
mean
every
word
I
said
to
you
He
will
try
to
take
away
my
pain
And
he
just
might
make
me
smile
But
the
whole
time,
I
am
wishing
he
was
you
instead
Oh,
holding
my
breath
Won't
see
you
again
Something
keeps
me
holding
onto
nothing
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Something's
gone
terribly
wrong
You're
all
I
wanted
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Can't
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
Can't
turn
back
now,
I
am
haunted
I
know,
I
know
I
just
know
You're
not
gone
You
cannot
be
gone,
no
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Something's
gone
terribly
wrong
(Terribly
wrong)
Won't
finish
what
you
started
Come
on,
come
on,
do
not
leave
me
like
this
I
thought
I
had
you
figured
out
Can't
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
I
cannot
go
back,
I
am
haunted
Oh
You
and
I
walk
a
fragile
line
I
have
known
it
all
this
time
Never
ever
thought
I
would
see
it
break
Never
thought
I
would
see
it
