elevator
buttons
and
morning
air
strangers
'
silence
makes
me
want
to
take
the
stairs
if
you
were
here
,
we
'd
laugh
about
their
vacant
stares
but
right
now
,
my
time
is
theirs
seems
like
there
's
always
someone
who
disapproves
they
'll
judge
it
like
they
know
about
me
and
you
and
the
verdict
comes
from
those
with
nothing
else
to
do
the
jury
's
out
,
but
my
choice
is
you
so
do
n't
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
,
the
water
's
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
you
never
know
what
people
have
up
their
sleeves
ghosts
from
your
past
gon
na
jump
out
at
me
lurking
in
the
shadows
with
their
lip
gloss
smiles
but
i
do
n't
care
,
'cause
right
now
,
you
're
mine
and
you
'll
say
do
n't
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
,
the
water
's
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
and
it
's
not
theirs
to
speculate
if
it
's
wrong
and
your
hands
are
tough
,
but
they
are
where
mine
belong
and
i
'll
fight
their
doubt
and
give
you
faith
with
this
song
for
you
'cause
i
love
the
gap
between
your
teeth
and
i
love
the
riddles
that
you
speak
and
any
snide
remarks
from
my
father
about
your
tattoos
will
be
ignored
,
'cause
my
heart
is
yours
so
do
n't
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
do
n't
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
but
they
ca
n't
take
what
's
ours
they
ca
n't
take
what
's
ours
the
stakes
are
high
,
the
water
's
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
