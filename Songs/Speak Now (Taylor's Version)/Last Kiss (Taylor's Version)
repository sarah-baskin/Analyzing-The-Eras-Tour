i
still
remember
the
look
on
your
face
lit
through
the
darkness
at
1:58
the
words
that
you
whispered
for
just
us
to
know
you
told
me
you
loved
me
,
so
why
did
you
go
away
?
away
i
do
recall
now
,
the
smell
of
the
rain
fresh
on
the
pavement
,
i
ran
off
the
plane
that
july
ninth
,
the
beat
of
your
heart
it
jumps
through
your
shirt
,
i
can
still
feel
your
arms
but
now
i
'll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearin
'
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
do
n't
know
how
to
be
somethin
'
you
miss
i
never
thought
we
'd
have
a
last
kiss
i
never
imagined
we
'd
end
like
this
your
name
,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
i
do
remember
the
swing
of
your
step
the
life
of
the
party
,
you
're
showin
'
off
again
and
i
'd
roll
my
eyes
and
then
you
'd
pull
me
in
i
'm
not
much
for
dancin
'
,
but
for
you
,
i
did
because
i
love
your
handshake
meetin
'
my
father
i
love
how
you
walk
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
how
you
'd
kiss
me
when
i
was
in
the
middle
of
saying
something
there
's
not
a
day
i
do
n't
miss
those
rude
interruptions
and
i
'll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearin
'
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
do
n't
know
how
to
be
somethin
'
you
miss
i
never
thought
we
'd
have
a
last
kiss
i
never
imagined
we
'd
end
like
this
your
name
,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
,
mmm
so
i
'll
watch
your
life
in
pictures
like
i
used
to
watch
you
sleep
and
i
feel
you
forget
me
like
i
used
to
feel
you
breathe
and
i
'll
keep
up
with
our
old
friends
just
to
ask
them
how
you
are
hope
it
's
nice
where
you
are
and
i
hope
the
sun
shines
and
it
's
a
beautiful
day
and
something
reminds
you
you
wish
you
had
stayed
you
can
plan
for
a
change
in
the
weather
and
time
but
i
never
planned
on
you
changing
your
mind
so
i
'll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearin
'
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
do
n't
know
how
to
be
somethin
'
you
miss
i
never
thought
we
'd
have
a
last
kiss
i
never
imagined
we
'd
end
like
this
your
name
,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
kiss
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
