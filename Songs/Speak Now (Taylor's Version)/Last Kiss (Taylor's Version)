I
still
remember
the
look
on
your
face
Lit
through
the
darkness
at
1:58
The
words
that
you
whispered
for
just
us
to
know
You
told
me
you
loved
me,
so
why
did
you
go
away?
Away
I
do
recall
now,
the
smell
of
the
rain
Fresh
on
the
pavement,
I
ran
off
the
plane
That
July
ninth,
the
beat
of
your
heart
It
jumps
through
your
shirt,
I
can
still
feel
your
arms
But
now
I
will
go
Sit
on
the
floor
wearin'
your
clothes
All
that
I
know
is
I
do
not
know
How
to
be
somethin'
you
miss
I
never
thought
we
would
have
a
last
kiss
I
never
imagined
we
would
end
like
this
Your
name,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
I
do
remember
the
swing
of
your
step
The
life
of
the
party,
you
are
showin'
off
again
And
I
would
roll
my
eyes
and
then
you
would
pull
me
in
I
am
not
much
for
dancin',
but
for
you,
I
did
Because
I
love
your
handshake
meetin'
my
father
I
love
how
you
walk
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
How
you
would
kiss
me
when
I
was
in
the
middle
of
saying
something
There's
not
a
day
I
do
not
miss
those
rude
interruptions
And
I
will
go
Sit
on
the
floor
wearin'
your
clothes
All
that
I
know
is
I
do
not
know
How
to
be
somethin'
you
miss
I
never
thought
we
would
have
a
last
kiss
I
never
imagined
we
would
end
like
this
Your
name,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips,
mmm
So
I
will
watch
your
life
in
pictures
like
I
used
to
watch
you
sleep
And
I
feel
you
forget
me
like
I
used
to
feel
you
breathe
And
I
will
keep
up
with
our
old
friends
just
to
ask
them
how
you
are
Hope
it
is
nice
where
you
are
And
I
hope
the
sun
shines
and
it
is
a
beautiful
day
And
something
reminds
you
you
wish
you
had
stayed
You
can
plan
for
a
change
in
the
weather
and
time
But
I
never
planned
on
you
changing
your
mind
So
I
will
go
Sit
on
the
floor
wearin'
your
clothes
All
that
I
know
is
I
do
not
know
How
to
be
somethin'
you
miss
I
never
thought
we
would
have
a
last
kiss
I
never
imagined
we
would
end
like
this
Your
name,
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
Just
like
our
last
kiss
Forever
the
name
on
my
lips
Forever
the
name
on
my
lips
Just
like
our
last
