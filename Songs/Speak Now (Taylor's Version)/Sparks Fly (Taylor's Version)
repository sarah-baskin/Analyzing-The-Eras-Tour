The
way
you
move
is
like
a
full
on
rainstorm
And
I
am
a
house
of
cards
You're
the
kind
of
reckless
that
should
send
me
runnin'
But
I
kind
of
know
that
I
will
not
get
far
And
you
stood
there
in
front
of
me,
just
close
enough
to
touch
Close
enough
to
hope
you
could
not
see
what
I
was
thinkin'
of
Drop
everything
now,
meet
me
in
the
pouring
rain
Kiss
me
on
the
sidewalk,
take
away
the
pain
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
Get
me
with
those
green
eyes,
baby,
as
the
lights
go
down
Give
me
something
that
will
haunt
me
when
you
are
not
around
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
My
mind
forgets
to
remind
me
you
are
a
bad
idea
You
touch
me
once
and
it
is
really
somethin'
You
find
I
am
even
better
than
you
imagined
I
would
be
I
am
on
my
guard
for
the
rest
of
the
world
But
with
you,
I
know
it
is
no
good
And
I
could
wait
patiently,
but
I
really
wish
you
would
Drop
everything
now,
meet
me
in
the
pouring
rain
Kiss
me
on
the
sidewalk,
take
away
the
pain
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
Get
me
with
those
green
eyes,
baby,
as
the
lights
go
down
Give
me
something
that
will
haunt
me
when
you
are
not
around
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
I
will
run
my
fingers
through
your
hair
and
watch
the
lights
go
wild
Just
keep
on
keepin'
your
eyes
on
me
It's
just
wrong
enough
to
make
it
feel
right
And
lead
me
up
the
staircase,
will
not
you
whisper
soft
and
slow?
I
am
captivated
by
you,
baby,
like
a
fireworks
show
Drop
everything
now,
meet
me
in
the
pouring
rain
Kiss
me
on
the
sidewalk
(Ah-ah),
take
away
the
pain
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
Get
me
with
those
green
eyes,
baby,
as
the
lights
go
down
Give
me
something
that
will
haunt
me
when
you
are
not
around
'Cause
I
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
And
the
sparks
fly
Oh,
baby,
smile
And
the
sparks
fly
