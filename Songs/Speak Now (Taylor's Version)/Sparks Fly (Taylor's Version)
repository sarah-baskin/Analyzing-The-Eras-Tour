the
way
you
move
is
like
a
full
on
rainstorm
and
i
'm
a
house
of
cards
you
're
the
kind
of
reckless
that
should
send
me
runnin
'
but
i
kinda
know
that
i
wo
n't
get
far
and
you
stood
there
in
front
of
me
,
just
close
enough
to
touch
close
enough
to
hope
you
could
n't
see
what
i
was
thinkin
'
of
drop
everything
now
,
meet
me
in
the
pouring
rain
kiss
me
on
the
sidewalk
,
take
away
the
pain
'cause
i
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
get
me
with
those
green
eyes
,
baby
,
as
the
lights
go
down
give
me
something
that
'll
haunt
me
when
you
're
not
around
'cause
i
see
sparks
fly
whenever
you
smile
my
mind
forgets
to
remind
me
you
're
a
bad
idea
you
touch
me
once
and
it
's
really
somethin
'
you
find
i
'm
even
better
than
you
imagined
i
would
be
i
'm
on
my
guard
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
with
you
,
i
know
it
's
no
good
and
i
could
wait
patiently
,
but
i
really
wish
you
would
drop
everything
now
,
meet
me
in
the
pouring
rain

me
on
the
sidewalk

smile
i
'll
run
my
fingers
through
your
hair
and
watch
the
lights

wild
just
keep
on
keepin
'
your
eyes
on
me
it
's
just
wrong
enough
to
make
it
feel
right
and
lead
me
up
the
staircase
,
wo
n't
you
whisper
soft
and
slow
?
i
'm
captivated
by
you
