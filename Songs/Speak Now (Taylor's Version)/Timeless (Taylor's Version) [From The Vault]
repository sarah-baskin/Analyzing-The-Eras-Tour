down
the
block
,
there
's
an
antique
shop
and
something
in
my
head
said
,
``
stop
,
''
so
i
walked
in
on
the
counter
was
a
cardboard
box
and
the
sign
said
,
``
photos
:
twenty-five
cents
each
''
black
and
white
,
saw
a
30s
bride
and
school
lovers
laughin
'
on
the
porch
of
their
first
house
the
kinda
love
that
you
only
find
once
in
a
lifetime
the
kind
you
do
n't
put
down
and
that
's
when
i
called
you
and
it
's
so
hard
to
explain
but
in
those
photos
,
i
saw
us
instead
and
,
somehow
,
i
know
that
you
and
i
would
've
found
each
other
in
another
life
,
you
still
would
've
turned
my
head
even
if
we
'd
met
on
a
crowded
street
in
1944
and
you
were
headed
off
to
fight
in
the
war
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
have
been
timeless
i
would
've
read
your
love
letters
every
single
night
and
prayed
to
god
you
'd
be
comin
'
home
all
right
and
you
would
've
been
fine
we
would
have
been
timeless
'cause
i
believe
that
we
were
supposed
to
find
this
so
,
even
in
a
different
life
,
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
've
been
timeless
i
had
to
smile
when
it
caught
my
eye
there
was
one
of
a
teenage
couple
in
the
driveway
holdin
'
hands
on
the
way
to
a
dance
and
the
date
on
the
back
said
1958
which
brought
me
back
to
the
first
time
i
saw
you
time
stood
still
like
somethin
'
in
this
old
shop
i
thought
about
it
as
i
started
lookin
'
'round
at
these
precious
things
that
time
forgot
that
's
when
i
came
upon
a
book
covered
in
cobwebs
story
of
a
romance
torn
apart
by
fate
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
they
fell
in
love
,
like
we
did
and
i
'd
die
for
you
in
the
same
way
if
i
first
saw
your
face
in
the
1500s
,
off
in
a
foreign
land
and
i
was
forced
to
marry
another
man
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
have
been
timeless
i
would
've
read
your
love
letters
every
single
night
and
run
away
and
left
it
all
behind
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
've
been
timeless
'cause
i
believe
that
we
were
supposed
to
find
this
so
,
even
in
a
different
life
,
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
've
been
timeless
time
breaks
down
your
mind
and
body
do
n't
you
let
it
touch
your
soul
it
was
like
an
age-old
classic
the
first
time
that
you
saw
me
the
story
started
when
you
said
,
``
hello
''
in
a
crowded
room
a
few
short
years
ago
and
sometimes
there
's
no
proof
,
you
just
know
you
're
always
gon
na
be
mine
we
're
gon
na
be
i
'm
gon
na
love
you
when
our
hair
is
turnin
'
gray
we
'll
have
a
cardboard
box
of
photos
of
the
life
we
've
made
and
you
'll
say
,
``
oh
my
,
we
really
were
timeless
''
we
're
gon
na
be
timeless
,
timeless
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
've
been
even
if
we
'd
met
on
a
crowded
street
in
1944
you
still
would
've
been
mine
we
would
've
been
down
the
block
,
there
's
an
antique
shop
and
somethin
'
in
my
head
said
,
``
stop
,
''
so
i
walked
in
