i
'm
so
glad
you
made
time
to
see
me
how
's
life
?
tell
me
,
how
's
your
family
?
i
have
n't
seen
them
in
a
while
you
've
been
good
,
busier
than
ever
we
small
talk
,
work
and
the
weather
your
guard
is
up
and
i
know
why
because
the
last
time
you
saw
me
is
still
burned
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
gave
me
roses
and
i
left
them
there
to
die
so
,
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standin
'
in
front
of
you
sayin
'
,
``
i
'm
sorry
for
that
night
''
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ai
n't
nothing
but
missin
'
you
wishin
'
i
'd
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
go
back
to
december
,
turn
around
and
make
it
alright
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
these
days
,
i
have
n't
been
sleeping
stayin
'
up
,
playing
back
myself
leavin
'
when
your
birthday
passed
and
i
did
n't
call
then
i
think
about
summer
,
all
the
beautiful
times
i
watched
you
laughin
'
from
the
passenger
side
and
realized
i
loved
you
in
the
fall
and
then
the
cold
came
,
the
dark
days
when
fear
crept
into
my
mind
you
gave
me
all
your
love
and
all
i
gave
you
was
goodbye
so
,
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standin
'
in
front
of
you
,
sayin
'
,
``
i
'm
sorry
for
that
night
''
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ai
n't
nothing
but
missin
'
you
wishin
'
i
'd
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
go
back
to
december
,
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
i
miss
your
tanned
skin
,
your
sweet
smile
so
good
to
me
,
so
right
and
how
you
held
me
in
your
arms
that
september
night
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
me
cry
maybe
this
is
wishful
thinkin
'
probably
mindless
dreaming
but
if
we
loved
again
,
i
swear
i
'd
love
you
right
i
'd
go
back
in
time
and
change
it
,
but
i
ca
n't
so
,
if
the
chain
is
on
your
door
,
i
understand
but
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standin
'
in
front
of
you
,
sayin
'
,
``
i
'm
sorry
for
that
night
''
and
i
go
back
to
december
it
turns
out
