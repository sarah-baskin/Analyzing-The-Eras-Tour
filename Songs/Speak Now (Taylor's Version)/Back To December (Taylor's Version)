I
am
so
glad
you
made
time
to
see
me
How's
life?
Tell
me,
how
is
your
family?
I
have
not
seen
them
in
a
while
You've
been
good,
busier
than
ever
We
small
talk,
work
and
the
weather
Your
guard
is
up
and
I
know
why
Because
the
last
time
you
saw
me
Is
still
burned
in
the
back
of
your
mind
You
gave
me
roses
and
I
left
them
there
to
die
So,
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
Standin'
in
front
of
you
sayin',
"I'm
sorry
for
that
night"
And
I
go
back
to
December
all
the
time
It
turns
out
freedom
are
not
nothing
but
missin'
you
Wishin'
I
would
realized
what
I
had
when
you
were
mine
I
go
back
to
December,
turn
around
and
make
it
alright
I
go
back
to
December
all
the
time
These
days,
I
have
not
been
sleeping
Stayin'
up,
playing
back
myself
leavin'
When
your
birthday
passed
and
I
did
not
call
Then
I
think
about
summer,
all
the
beautiful
times
I
watched
you
laughin'
from
the
passenger
side
And
realized
I
loved
you
in
the
fall
And
then
the
cold
came,
the
dark
days
When
fear
crept
into
my
mind
You
gave
me
all
your
love
and
all
I
gave
you
was
goodbye
So,
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
Standin'
in
front
of
you,
sayin',
"I'm
sorry
for
that
night"
And
I
go
back
to
December
all
the
time
It
turns
out
freedom
are
not
nothing
but
missin'
you
Wishin'
I
would
realized
what
I
had
when
you
were
mine
I
go
back
to
December,
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
I
go
back
to
December
all
the
time
I
miss
your
tanned
skin,
your
sweet
smile
So
good
to
me,
so
right
And
how
you
held
me
in
your
arms
that
September
night
The
first
time
you
ever
saw
me
cry
Maybe
this
is
wishful
thinkin'
Probably
mindless
dreaming
But
if
we
loved
again,
I
swear
I
would
love
you
right
I
would
go
back
in
time
and
change
it,
but
I
cannot
So,
if
the
chain
is
on
your
door,
I
understand
But
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
Standin'
in
front
of
you,
sayin',
"I'm
sorry
for
that
night"
And
I
go
back
to
December
It
turns
out
freedom
are
not
nothing
but
missin'
you
Wishin'
I
would
realized
what
I
had
when
you
were
mine
I
go
back
to
December,
turn
around
and
make
it
alright
I
go
back
to
December,
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
I
go
back
to
December
all
the
time
All
the
time
