Tall,
dark,
and
superman
He
puts
papers
in
his
briefcase
and
drives
away
To
save
the
world
or
go
to
work
It's
the
same
thing
to
me
He's
got
his
mother's
eyes,
his
father's
ambition
I
wonder
if
he
knows
how
much
that
I
miss
him
I
hang
on
every
word
you
say
And
you
smile
and
say,
"How
are
you?"
And
I
will
say,
"Just
fine"
I
always
forget
to
tell
you,
"I
love
you"
I
love
you
forever
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
You've
got
a
busy
day
today
Go
save
the
world,
I
will
be
around
And
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
Come
back,
I
will
be
with
you
someday
I
will
be
right
here
on
the
ground
When
you
come
back
down
Tall,
dark
and
beautiful
He's
complicated,
he
is
irrational
But
I
hope
someday
you
will
take
me
away,
and
save
the
day,
yeah
Something
in
his
deep
brown
eyes
has
me
sayin'
He's
not
all
bad
like
his
reputation
And
I
cannot
hear
one
single
word
they
say
And
you
will
leave,
got
places
to
be,
and
I
will
be
okay
I
always
forget
to
tell
you,
"I
love
you"
I
loved
you
from
the
very
first
day
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
You've
got
a
busy
day
today
Go
save
the
world,
I
will
be
around
And
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
Come
back,
I
will
be
with
you
someday
I
will
be
right
here
on
the
ground
When
you
come
back
down
And
I
watch
you
fly
around
the
world
And
I
hope
you
do
not
save
some
other
girl
Don't
forget,
do
not
forget
about
me
I
am
far
away,
but
I
never
let
you
go
I
am
love-struck
and
looking
out
the
window
Don't
forget,
do
not
forget
where
I
will
be
Right
here,
wishing
the
flowers
were
from
you
Wishing
the
card
was
from
you
Wishing
the
call
was
from
you
'Cause
I
loved
you
from
the
very
first
day
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
You've
got
a
busy
day
today
Go
save
the
world,
I
will
be
around
Forever
and
ever
And
I
watch
Superman
fly
away
I
swear,
I
will
be
with
you
someday
I
will
be
right
here
on
the
ground
When
you
come
back
down
La,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la
La,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la
When
you
come
back
down
