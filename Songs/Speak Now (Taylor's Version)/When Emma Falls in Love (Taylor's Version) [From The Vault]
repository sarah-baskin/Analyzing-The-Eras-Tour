When
Emma
falls
in
love,
she
paces
the
floor
Closes
the
blinds
and
locks
the
door
When
Emma
falls
in
love,
she
calls
up
her
mom
Jokes
about
the
ways
that
this
one
could
go
wrong
She
waits
and
takes
her
time
'Cause
Little
Miss
Sunshine
always
thinks
it
is
going
to
rain
When
Emma
falls
in
love,
I
know
That
boy
will
never
be
the
same
'Cause
she
is
the
kind
of
book
that
you
cannot
put
down
Like
if
Cleopatra
grew
up
in
a
small
town
And
all
the
bad
boys
would
be
good
boys
If
they
only
had
a
chance
to
love
her
And
to
tell
you
the
truth,
sometimes
I
wish
I
was
her
When
Emma
falls
in
love,
it
is
all
on
her
face
Hangs
in
the
air
like
stars
in
outer
space
When
Emma
falls
in
love,
she
disappears
And
we
all
just
laugh
after
seein'
it
all
these
years
When
Emma
falls
apart,
it
is
when
she
is
alone
She
takes
on
the
pain
and
bears
it
on
her
own
'Cause
when
Emma
falls
in
love,
she
is
in
it
for
keeps
She
will
not
walk
away
unless
she
knows
she
absolutely
has
to
leave
And
she
is
the
kind
of
book
that
you
cannot
put
down
Like
if
Cleopatra
grew
up
in
a
small
town
And
all
the
bad
boys
would
be
good
boys
If
they
only
had
a
chance
to
love
her
And
to
tell
you
the
truth,
sometimes
I
wish
I
was
her
Well,
she
is
so
New
York
when
she
is
in
L.A.
She
will
not
lose
herself
in
love
the
way
that
I
did
'Cause
she
will
call
you
out,
she
will
put
you
in
your
place
When
Emma
falls
in
love,
I
am
learning
Emma
met
a
boy
with
eyes
like
a
man
Turns
out
her
heart
fits
right
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
Now
he
will
be
her
shelter
when
it
rains
Little
does
he
know,
his
whole
world's
about
to
change
'Cause
she
is
the
kind
of
book
that
you
cannot
put
down
Like
if
Cleopatra
grew
up
in
a
small
town
And
all
the
bad
boys
would
be
good
boys
If
they
only
had
a
chance
to
love
her
And
to
tell
you
the
truth,
sometimes
I
wish
I
was
her
Yeah,
between
me
and
you,
sometimes
I
wish
I
was
her
