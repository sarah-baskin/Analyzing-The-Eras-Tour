i
said
,
``
remember
this
moment
''
in
the
back
of
my
mind
the
time
we
stood
with
our
shaking
hands
the
crowds
in
stands
went
wild
we
were
the
kings
and
the
queens
and
they
read
off
our
names
the
night
you
danced
like
you
knew
our
lives
would
never
be
the
same
you
held
your
head
like
a
hero
on
a
history
book
page
it
was
the
end
of
a
decade
but
the
start
of
an
age
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
,
``
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
''
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
,
we
will
be
remembered
i
said
,
``
remember
this
feeling
''
i
pass
the
pictures
around
of
all
the
years
that
we
stood
there
on
the
sidelines
wishin
'
for
right
now
we
are
the
kings
and
the
queens
you
traded
your
baseball
cap
for
a
crown
when
they
gave
us
our
trophies
and
we
held
them
up
for
our
town
and
the
cynics
were
outraged
screaming
,
``
this
is
absurd
''
'cause
for
a
moment
,
a
band
of
thieves
in
ripped
up
jeans
got
to
rule
the
world
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
,
``
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
''
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
,
i
'm
not
afraid
long
live
all
the
mountains
we
moved
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
fighting
dragons
with
you
i
was
screaming
,
``
long
live
that
look
on
your
face
''
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
,
we
will
be
remembered
hold
on
to
spinning
around
confetti
falls
to
the
ground
may
these
memories
break
our
fall
will
you
take
a
moment
?
promise
me
this
that
you
'll
stand
by
me
forever
but
if
,
god
forbid
,
fate
should
step
in
and
force
us
into
a
goodbye
if
you
have
children
some
day
when
they
point
to
the
pictures
please
,
tell
'em
my
name
tell
'em
how
the
crowds
went
wild
tell
'em
how
i
hope
they
shine
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
with
you

,
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the

just
for
me
and
you
