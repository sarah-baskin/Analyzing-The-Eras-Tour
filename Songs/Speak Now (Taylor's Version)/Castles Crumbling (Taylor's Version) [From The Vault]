taylor
swift
&
hayley
once
,
i
was
the
great
hope
for
a
dynasty
crowds
would
hang
on
my
words
and
they
trusted
me
their
faith
was
strong
,
but
i
pushed
it
too
far
i
held
that
grudge
'til
it
tore
me
apart
taylor

&
hayley
williams
,
taylor
power
went
to
my
head
and
i
could
n't
stop
ones
i
loved
tried
to
help
,
so
i
ran
them
off
and
here
i
sit
alone
behind
walls
of
regret
falling
down
like
promises
that
i
never
kept

from
my
ships
