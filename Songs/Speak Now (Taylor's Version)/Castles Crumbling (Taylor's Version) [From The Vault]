(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
Once,
I
had
an
empire
in
a
golden
age
I
was
held
up
so
high,
I
used
to
be
great
They
used
to
cheer
when
they
saw
my
face
Now,
I
fear
I
have
fallen
from
grace
And
I
feel
like
my
castle's
crumbling
down
And
I
watch
all
my
bridges
burn
to
the
ground
And
you
do
not
want
to
know
me,
I
will
just
let
you
down
You
do
not
want
to
know
me
now
Once,
I
was
the
great
hope
for
a
dynasty
Crowds
would
hang
on
my
words
and
they
trusted
me
Their
faith
was
strong,
but
I
pushed
it
too
far
I
held
that
grudge
'til
it
tore
me
apart
Power
went
to
my
head
and
I
could
not
stop
Ones
I
loved
tried
to
help,
so
I
ran
them
off
And
here
I
sit
alone
behind
walls
of
regret
Falling
down
like
promises
that
I
never
kept
And
I
feel
like
my
castle's
crumbling
down
And
I
watch
all
my
bridges
burn
to
the
ground
And
you
do
not
want
to
know
me,
I
will
just
let
you
down
You
do
not
want
to
know
me
now
My
foes
and
friends
watch
my
reign
end
I
do
not
know
how
it
could
have
ended
this
way
Smoke
billows
from
my
ships
in
the
harbor
People
look
at
me
like
I
am
a
monster
Now
they
are
screamin'
at
the
palace
front
gates
Used
to
chant
my
name
Now
they
are
screaming
that
they
hate
me
Never
wanted
you
to
hate
me
My
castle's
crumbling
down
And
I
watch
all
my
bridges
burn
to
the
ground
And
you
do
not
want
to
know
me,
I
will
just
let
you
down
(Just
let
you
down)
My
castle's
crumbling
down
You
do
not
want
to
know
me
now,
now
(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
(Once,
I
had
an
empire)
