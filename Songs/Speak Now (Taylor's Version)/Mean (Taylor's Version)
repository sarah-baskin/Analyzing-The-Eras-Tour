You,
with
your
words
like
knives
And
swords
and
weapons
that
you
use
against
me
You
have
knocked
me
off
my
feet
again
Got
me
feelin'
like
a
nothing
You,
with
your
voice
like
nails
on
a
chalkboard
Calling
me
out
when
I
am
wounded
You,
pickin'
on
the
weaker
man
Well,
you
can
take
me
down
With
just
one
single
blow
But
you
do
not
know
what
you
do
not
know
Someday,
I
will
be
livin'
in
a
big
ole
city
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Someday,
I
will
be
big
enough
so
you
cannot
hit
me
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?
You,
with
your
switching
sides
And
your
wildfire
lies
and
your
humiliation
You
have
pointed
out
my
flaws
again
As
if
I
do
not
already
see
them
I
walk
with
my
head
down,
trying
to
block
you
out
'Cause
I
will
never
impress
you
I
just
want
to
feel
okay
again
I
bet
you
got
pushed
around
Somebody
made
you
cold
But
the
cycle
ends
right
now
'Cause
you
cannot
lead
me
down
that
road
And
you
do
not
know
what
you
do
not
know
Someday,
I
will
be
livin'
in
a
big
ole
city
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Someday,
I
will
be
big
enough
so
you
cannot
hit
me
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?
And
I
can
see
you
years
from
now
in
a
bar
Talking
over
a
football
game
With
that
same
big,
loud
opinion,
but
nobody's
listening
Washed
up
and
ranting
about
the
same
ole
bitter
things
Drunk
and
grumbling
on
about
how
I
cannot
sing
But
all
you
are
is
mean
All
you
are
is
mean
And
a
liar,
and
pathetic
And
alone
in
life,
and
mean
And
mean,
and
mean,
and
mean
But
someday,
I
will
be
livin'
in
a
big
ole
city
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean,
yeah
Someday,
I
will
be
big
enough
so
you
cannot
hit
me
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?
Someday,
I
will
be
livin'
in
a
big
ole
city
(Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?)
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
(Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?)
Someday,
I
will
be
big
enough
so
you
cannot
hit
me
(Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?)
And
all
you
are
ever
going
to
be
is
mean
Why
you
got
to
be
so
mean?
