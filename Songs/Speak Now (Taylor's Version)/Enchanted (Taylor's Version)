there
i
was
again
tonight
forcing
laughter
,
faking
smiles
same
old
tired
,
lonely
place
walls
of
insincerity
shifting
eyes
and
vacancy
vanished
when
i
saw
your
face
all
i
can
say
is
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you
your
eyes
whispered
,
``
have
we
met
?
''
across
the
room
,
your
silhouette
starts
to
make
its
way
to
me
the
playful
conversation
starts
counter
all
your
quick
remarks
like
passing
notes
in
secrecy
and
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you
all
i
can
say
is
i
was
enchanted
to
meet
you
this
night
is
sparklin
'
,
do
n't
you
let
it
go
i
'm
wonderstruck
,
blushin
'
all
the
way
home
i
'll
spend
forever
wonderin
'
if
you
knew
i
was
enchanted
to
meet
you
the
lingering
question
kept
me
up
2
a.m.
,
who
do
you
love
?
i
wonder
'til
i
'm
wide
awake
and
now
,
i
'm
pacing
back
and
forth
wishing
you
were
at
my
door
i
'd
open
up
and
you
would
say
``
hey
,
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you
''
all
i
know
is
i
was
enchanted
to
meet
you
this
night
is
sparklin
'
,
do
n't
you
let
it
go
i
'm
wonderstruck
,
blushin
'
all
the
way
home
i
'll
spend
forever
wonderin
'
if
you
knew
this
night
is
flawless
,
do
n't
you
let
it
go
i
'm
wonderstruck
,
dancing
around
all
alone
i
'll
spend
forever
wonderin
'
if
you
knew
i
was
enchanted
to
meet
you
this
is
me
praying
that
this
was
the
very
first
page
not
where
the
storyline
ends
my
thoughts
will
echo
your
name
until
i
see
you
again
these
are
the
words
i
held
back
as
i
was
leaving
too
soon
i
was
enchanted
to
meet
you

do
n't
be
in
love
with
someone
