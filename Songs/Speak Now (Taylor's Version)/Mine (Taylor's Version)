Ah-ah,
ah-ah
Ah-ah,
ah-ah
You
were
in
college
working
part-time,
waiting
tables
Left
a
small
town,
never
looked
back
I
was
a
flight
risk
with
a
fear
of
falling
Wondering
why
we
bother
with
love
if
it
never
lasts
I
say,
"Can
you
believe
it?"
As
we
are
lying
on
the
couch
The
moment
I
could
see
it
Yes,
yes,
I
can
see
it
now
Do
you
remember,
we
were
sitting
there
by
the
water?
You
put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
that
is
ever
been
mine
Flash
forward
and
we
are
taking
on
the
world
together
And
there
is
a
drawer
of
my
things
at
your
place
You
learn
my
secrets
and
you
figure
out
why
I
am
guarded
You
say
we
will
never
make
my
parents'
mistakes
But
we
got
bills
to
pay
We
got
nothing
figured
out
When
it
was
hard
to
take
Yes,
yes,
this
is
what
I
thought
about
Do
you
remember,
we
were
sitting
there
by
the
water?
You
put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
that
is
ever
been
mine
Do
you
remember
all
the
city
lights
on
the
water?
You
saw
me
start
to
believe
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
that
is
ever
been
mine
Oh-oh,
oh
And
I
remember
that
fight,
2:30
AM
As
everything
was
slipping
right
out
of
our
hands
I
ran
out
crying
and
you
followed
me
out
into
the
street
Braced
myself
for
the
goodbye
'Cause
it
is
all
I
have
ever
known
Then
you
took
me
by
surprise
You
said,
"I'll
never
leave
you
alone"
(Oh)
You
said,
"I
remember
how
we
felt
sitting
by
the
water
And
every
time
I
look
at
you,
it
is
like
the
first
time
I
fell
in
love
with
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter
She
is
the
best
thing
that
is
ever
been
mine"
Hold
on,
make
it
last
Hold
on,
never
turn
back
(Hold
on)
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter
(Hold
on)
You
are
the
best
thing
that
is
ever
been
mine
Do
you
believe
it?
(Yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
We're
going
to
make
it
now
(Yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
And
I
can
see
it
(Yeah,
yeah)
I
can
see
it
now
