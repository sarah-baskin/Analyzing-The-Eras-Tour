you
were
in
college
working
part-time
,
waiting
tables
left
a
small
town
,
never
looked
back
i
was
a
flight
risk
with
a
fear
of
falling
wondering
why
we
bother
with
love
if
it
never
lasts
i
say
,
``
can
you
believe
it
?
''
as
we
're
lying
on
the
couch
the
moment
i
could
see
it
yes
,
yes
,
i
can
see
it
now
do
you
remember
,
we
were
sitting
there
by
the
water
?
you
put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first
time
you
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man
's
careful
daughter
you
are
the
best
thing
that
's
ever
been
mine
flash
forward
and
we
're
taking
on
the
world
together
and
there
's
a
drawer
of
my
things
at
your
place
you
learn
my
secrets
and
you
figure
out
why
i
'm
guarded
you
say
we
'll
never
make
my
parents
'
mistakes
but
we
got
bills
to
pay
we
got
nothing
figured
out
when
it
was
hard
to
take
yes
,

is
what
i
thought
about
do

remember
,
we
were
sitting
there
by
the
water

put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first

followed
me
out
into
the
street
braced
myself
for
the
goodbye
'cause

all
i
've
ever
known

you
took
me
by
surprise

said
,
``

'll
never
leave
you
alone
''
(

said
,
``

by
the
water

first
time

fell
in
love
