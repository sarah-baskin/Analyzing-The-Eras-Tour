Your
little
hand's
wrapped
around
my
finger
And
it
is
so
quiet
in
the
world
tonight
Your
little
eyelids
flutter
because
you
are
dreaming
So
I
tuck
you
in,
turn
on
your
favorite
nightlight
To
you,
everything's
funny
You
got
nothing
to
regret
I
would
give
all
I
have,
honey
If
you
could
stay
like
that
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
just
stay
this
little
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
it
could
stay
this
simple
I
will
not
let
nobody
hurt
you
Won't
let
no
one
break
your
heart
And
no
one
will
desert
you
Just
try
to
never
grow
up
And
never
grow
up
You're
in
the
car,
on
the
way
to
the
movies
And
you
are
mortified
your
mom's
droppin'
you
off
At
fourteen,
there
is
just
so
much
you
cannot
do
And
you
cannot
wait
to
move
out
someday
and
call
your
own
shots
But
do
not
make
her
drop
you
off
around
the
block
Remember
that
she
is
gettin'
older,
too
And
do
not
lose
the
way
that
you
dance
around
In
your
PJs
getting
ready
for
school
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
just
stay
this
little
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
it
could
stay
this
simple
And
no
one's
ever
burned
you
Nothing's
ever
left
you
scarred
And
even
though
you
want
to
Just
try
to
never
grow
up
Take
pictures
in
your
mind
of
your
childhood
room
Memorize
what
it
sounded
like
when
your
dad
gets
home
Remember
the
footsteps,
remember
the
words
said
And
all
your
little
brother's
favorite
songs
I
just
realized
everything
I
have
is,
someday,
going
to
be
gone
So,
here
I
am
in
my
new
apartment
In
a
big
city,
they
just
dropped
me
off
It's
so
much
colder
than
I
thought
it
would
be
So
I
tuck
myself
in
and
turn
my
nightlight
on
Wish
I
would
never
grown
up
Wish
I
would
never
grown
up
Oh,
I
do
not
want
to
grow
up
Wish
I
would
never
grown
up,
I
could
still
be
little
Oh,
I
do
not
want
to
grow
up
Wish
I
would
never
grown
up,
it
could
still
be
simple
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
just
stay
this
little
Oh,
darling,
do
not
you
ever
grow
up
Don't
you
ever
grow
up,
it
could
stay
this
simple
I
will
not
let
nobody
hurt
you
(Never
grow
up)
Won't
let
no
one
break
your
heart
And
even
though
you
want
to
Please,
try
to
never
grow
up
Oh,
oh
(Never
grow
up)
Just
never
grow
up
Oh
(Never
grow
up)
Just
never
grow
up
