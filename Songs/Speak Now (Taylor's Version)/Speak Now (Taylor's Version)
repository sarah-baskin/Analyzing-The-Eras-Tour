i
am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
bargin
'
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but
you
are
not
the
kind
of
boy
who
should
be
marrying
the
wrong
girl
i
sneak
in
and
see
your
friends
and
her
snotty
little
family
all
dressed
in
pastel
and
she
is
yelling
at
a
bridesmaid
somewhere
back
inside
a
room
wearin
'
a
gown
shaped
like
a
pastry
this
is
surely
not
what
you
thought
it
would
be
i
lose
myself
in
a
daydream
where
i
stand
and
say
do
n't
say
yes
,

away
now
i
'll
meet
you
when
you
're
out
of
the
church
,
at
the
back
door
do
n't
wait
or
say
a
single
vow
you
need
to
hear
me
out
and
they
said
,
``
speak
now
''
fond
gestures
are
exchanged
and
the
organ
starts
to
play
a
song
that
sounds
like
a
death
march
and
i
am
hiding
in
the
curtains
it
seems
that
i
was
uninvited
by
your
lovely
bride-to-be
she
floats
down
the
aisle
like
a
pageant
queen
but
i
know
you
wish
it
was
me
you
wish
it
was
me
,
do
n't
you
?
do
n't
say
yes
,
run
away
now

'll
meet
you
when

're
out
of
the
church
,
at
the
back
door
do
n't
wait
or
say
a
single
vow
you
need
to
hear
me
out
and

peace
''
there
's
the
silence
,
there
's
my
last
chance
i
stand
up
with
shaky
hands
,
all
eyes
on
me
horrified
looks
from
everyone
in
the
room
but
i
'm
only
lookin
'
at
you

am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
bargin
'
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but

are
not
the
kind
of
