Just
breathe,
just
relax,
it
will
be
okay
Just
an
hour
'til
your
car's
in
the
driveway
Just
the
first
time
ever
hangin'
out
with
you
tonight
I
have
got
my
money
on
things
goin'
badly
Got
a
history
of
stories
ending
sadly
Still
hoping
that
the
fire
will
not
burn
me
Just
one
time,
just
one
time
All
I
know
is
this
could
either
break
my
heart
or
bring
it
back
to
life
Got
a
feelin'
your
electric
touch
could
fill
this
ghost
town
up
with
life
And
I
want
you
now,
want
to
need
you
forever
In
the
heat
of
your
electric
touch,
mmm
I
have
been
left
in
the
rain
lost
and
pining
I
am
tryin'
hard
not
to
look
like
I
am
trying
'Cause
every
time
I
tried
hard
for
love,
it
fell
apart
(Woah)
I
have
gotten
used
to
no
one
callin'
my
phone
I
have
grown
accustomed
to
sleepin'
alone
Still,
I
know
that
all
it
takes
is
to
get
it
right
Just
one
time,
just
one
time
All
I
know
is
this
could
either
break
my
heart
or
bring
it
back
to
life
Got
a
feelin'
your
electric
touch
could
fill
this
ghost
town
up
with
life
And
I
want
you
now,
want
to
need
you
forever
In
the
heat
of
your
electric
touch,
mmm
I
was
thinking
just
one
time
(Just
one
time)
Maybe
the
stars
align
(Just
one
time)
And
maybe
I
call
you
mine
And
you
will
not
need
space
Or
string
me
along
while
you
decide
And
just
one
time
(Just
one
time)
Maybe
the
moment's
right
(The
moment's
right)
It's
8:05
and
I
see
two
headlights
All
I
know
is
this
could
either
break
my
heart
or
bring
it
back
to
life
Got
a
feelin'
your
electric
touch
(Ooh)
All
I
know
is
this
could
either
break
my
heart
or
bring
it
back
to
life
Got
a
feelin'
your
electric
touch
could
fill
this
ghost
town
up
with
life
(Life)
And
I
want
you
now,
want
to
need
you
forever
In
the
heat
of
your
electric
touch,
mmm
