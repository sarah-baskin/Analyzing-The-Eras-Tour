Long
were
the
nights
When
my
days
once
revolved
around
you
Counting
my
footsteps
Prayin'
the
floor
will
not
fall
through
again
And
my
mother
accused
me
of
losin'
my
mind
But
I
swore
I
was
fine
You
paint
me
a
blue
sky
Then
go
back
and
turn
it
to
rain
And
I
lived
in
your
chess
game
But
you
change
the
rules
every
day
Wonderin'
which
version
of
you
I
might
get
on
the
phone
tonight
Well,
I
stopped
pickin'
up
And
this
song
is
to
let
you
know
why
Dear
John,
I
see
it
all
now
that
you
are
gone
Don't
you
think
I
was
too
young
to
be
messed
with?
The
girl
in
the
dress
cried
the
whole
way
home
I
shoulda
known
Well,
maybe
it
is
me
and
my
blind
optimism
to
blame
Or
maybe
it
is
you
and
your
sick
need
To
give
love
and
take
it
away
And
you
will
add
my
name
to
your
long
list
of
traitors
Who
do
not
understand
And
I
will
look
back
and
regret
how
I
ignored
when
they
said
"Run
as
fast
as
you
can"
Dear
John,
I
see
it
all
now
that
you
are
gone
Don't
you
think
I
was
too
young
to
be
messed
with?
The
girl
in
the
dress
cried
the
whole
way
home
Dear
John,
I
see
it
all
now,
it
was
wrong
Don't
you
think
nineteen's
too
young
to
be
played
by
Your
dark,
twisted
games
when
I
loved
you
so?
I
shoulda
known
You
are
an
expert
at
"Sorry"
and
keepin'
lines
blurry
Never
impressed
by
me
acing
your
tests
All
the
girls
that
you
run
dry
have
tired,
lifeless
eyes
'Cause
you
burned
them
out
But
I
took
your
matches
before
fire
could
catch
me
So
do
not
look
now
I
am
shining
like
fireworks
over
your
sad,
empty
town
Oh
Dear
John,
I
see
it
all
now
that
you
are
gone
Don't
you
think
I
was
too
young
to
be
messed
with?
The
girl
in
the
dress
cried
the
whole
way
home
I
see
it
all
now
that
you
are
gone
Don't
you
think
I
was
too
young
to
be
messed
with?
The
girl
in
the
dress
wrote
you
a
song
You
shoulda
known
You
shoulda
known
Don't
you
think
I
was
too
young?
You
shoulda
known
