he
said
the
way
my
blue
eyes
shined
put
those
georgia
stars
to
shame
that
night
i
said
,
``
that
's
a
lie
''
just
a
boy
in
a
chevy
truck
that
had
a
tendency
of
gettin
'
stuck
on
backroads
at
night
and
i
was
right
there
beside
him
all
summer
long
and
then
the
time
we
woke
up
to
find
that
summer
gone
but
when
you
think
tim
mcgraw
i
hope
you
think
my
favorite
song
the
one
we
danced
to
all
night
long
the
moon
like
a
spotlight
on
the
lake
when
you
think
happiness
i
hope
you
think
that
little
black
dress
think
of
my
head
on
your
chest
and
my
old
faded
blue
jeans
when
you
think
tim
mcgraw
i
hope
you
think
of
me
september
saw
a
month
of
tears
and
thankin
'
god
that
you
were
n't
here
to
see
me
like
that
but
in
a
box
beneath
my
bed
is
a
letter
that
you
never
read
from
three
summers
back
it
's
hard
not
to
find
it
all
a
little
bittersweet
and
lookin
'
back
on
all
of
that
,
it
's
nice
to
believe
when
you
think
tim
mcgraw
i
hope
you
think
my
favorite
song
the
one
we
danced
to
all
night
long
the
moon
like
a
spotlight
on
the
lake
when

hope
you
think
of
me
and
i
'm
back
for
the
first
time
since
then
i
'm
standin
'
on
your
street
and
there
's
a
letter
left
on
your
doorstep
and
the
first
thing
that
you
'll
read
is
,
``
when
you
think
tim
mcgraw
i
hope
you
think
my
favorite
song
someday
you
'll
turn
your
radio
on
i
hope
it
takes
you
back
to
that
place
