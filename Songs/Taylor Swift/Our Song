I
was
ridin'
shotgun
with
my
hair
undone
In
the
front
seat
of
his
car
He's
got
a
one-hand
feel
on
the
steering
wheel
The
other
on
my
heart
I
look
around,
turn
the
radio
down
He
says,
"Baby,
is
something
wrong?"
I
say,
"Nothin',
I
was
just
thinkin'
How
we
do
not
have
a
song"
And
he
says
Our
song
is
a
slamming
screen
door
Sneakin'
out
late,
tapping
on
your
window
When
we
are
on
the
phone
and
you
talk
real
slow
'Cause
it
is
late
and
your
mama
do
not
know
Our
song
is
the
way
you
laugh
The
first
date,
"Man,
I
did
not
kiss
her
and
I
should
have"
And
when
I
got
home,
'fore
I
said,
"Amen"
Askin'
God
if
he
could
play
it
again
I
was
walking
up
the
front
porch
steps
After
everything
that
day
Had
gone
all
wrong
and
been
trampled
on
And
lost
and
thrown
away
Got
to
the
hallway,
well
on
my
way
to
my
lovin'
bed
I
almost
did
not
notice
all
the
roses
And
the
note
that
said
Our
song
is
a
slamming
screen
door
Sneakin'
out
late,
tapping
on
your
window
When
we
are
on
the
phone
and
you
talk
real
slow
'Cause
it
is
late
and
your
mama
do
not
know
Our
song
is
the
way
you
laugh
The
first
date,
"Man,
I
did
not
kiss
her
and
I
should
have"
And
when
I
got
home,
'fore
I
said,
"Amen"
Askin'
God
if
he
could
play
it
again
Da-da-da-da
I
have
heard
every
album,
listened
to
the
radio
Waited
for
somethin'
to
come
along
That
was
as
good
as
our
song
'Cause
our
song
is
a
slamming
screen
door
Sneakin'
out
late,
tapping
on
his
window
When
we
are
on
the
phone
and
he
talks
real
slow
'Cause
it
is
late
and
his
mama
do
not
know
Our
song
is
the
way
he
laughs
The
first
date,
"Man,
I
did
not
kiss
him
and
I
should
have"
And
when
I
got
home,
'fore
I
said,
"Amen"
Askin'
God
if
he
could
play
it
again
Play
it
again,
oh
yeah
Oh-oh,
yeah
I
was
ridin'
shotgun
with
my
hair
undone
In
the
front
seat
of
his
car
I
grabbed
a
pen
and
an
old
napkin
And
I
wrote
down
our
song
