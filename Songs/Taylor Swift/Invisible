She
cannot
see
the
way
your
eyes
Light
up
when
you
smile
She'll
never
notice
how
you
stop
and
stare
Whenever
she
walks
by
And
you
cannot
see
me
wanting
you
the
way
you
want
her
But
you
are
everything
to
me
And
I
just
want
to
show
you
She
do
not
even
know
you
She's
never
going
to
love
you
like
I
want
to
And
you
just
see
right
through
me
But
if
you
only
knew
me
We
could
be
a
beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
Instead
of
just
invisible
Oh,
yeah,
oh
There's
a
fire
inside
of
you
That
cannot
help
but
shine
through
She's
never
going
to
see
the
light
No
matter
what
you
do
And
all
I
think
about
is
how
to
make
you
think
of
me
And
everything
that
we
could
be
And
I
just
want
to
show
you
She
do
not
even
know
you
She's
never
going
to
love
you
like
I
want
to
And
you
just
see
right
through
me
But
if
you
only
knew
me
We
could
be
a
beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
Instead
of
just
invisible
Like
shadows
in
a
faded
light
Oh,
we
are
invisible
I
just
want
to
open
your
eyes
And
make
you
realize
I
just
want
to
show
you
She
do
not
even
know
you
Baby,
let
me
love
you,
let
me
want
you
You
just
see
right
through
me
But
if
you
only
knew
me
We
could
be
a
beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
Instead
of
just
invisible
Oh,
yeah
She
cannot
see
the
way
your
eyes
Light
up
when
you
smile
