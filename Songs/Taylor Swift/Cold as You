you
have
a
way
of
coming
easily
to
me
and
when
you
take
,
you
take
the
very
best
of
me
so
i
start
a
fight
'cause
i
need
to
feel
something
and
you
do
what
you
want
'cause
i
'm
not
what
you
wanted
oh
,
what
a
shame
,
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
just
walk
away
,
ai
n't
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
'm
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
've
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
put
up
walls
and
paint
them
all
a
shade
of
gray
and
i
stood
there
loving
you
and
wished
them
all
away
and
you
come
away
with
a
great
little
story
of
a
mess
of
a
dreamer
with
the
nerve
to
adore
you
oh
,
what
a
shame
,
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
so
just
walk
away
,
ai
n't
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
'm
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
've
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
never
did
give
a
damn
thing
,
honey
but
i
cried
,
cried
for
you
and
i
know
you
would
n't
have
told
nobody
if
i
died
,
died
for
you
,
died
for
you
oh
,
what
a
shame
,
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
,
oh
every
smile
you
fake
is
so
condescending
counting
all
the
scars
you
made
and
now
that
i
'm
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
've
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
ooh-oh
