You
have
a
way
of
coming
easily
to
me
And
when
you
take,
you
take
the
very
best
of
me
So
I
start
a
fight
because
I
need
to
feel
something
And
you
do
what
you
want
because
I
am
not
what
you
wanted
Oh,
what
a
shame,
what
a
rainy
ending
Given
to
a
perfect
day
Just
walk
away,
are
not
no
use
defending
Words
that
you
will
never
say
And
now
that
I
am
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
I
have
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
You
put
up
walls
and
paint
them
all
a
shade
of
gray
And
I
stood
there
loving
you
and
wished
them
all
away
And
you
come
away
with
a
great
little
story
Of
a
mess
of
a
dreamer
with
the
nerve
to
adore
you
Oh,
what
a
shame,
what
a
rainy
ending
Given
to
a
perfect
day
So
just
walk
away,
are
not
no
use
defending
Words
that
you
will
never
say
And
now
that
I
am
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
I
have
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
You
never
did
give
a
damn
thing,
honey
But
I
cried,
cried
for
you
And
I
know
you
would
not
have
told
nobody
If
I
died,
died
for
you,
died
for
you
Oh,
what
a
shame,
what
a
rainy
ending
Given
to
a
perfect
day,
oh
Every
smile
you
fake
is
so
condescending
Counting
all
the
scars
you
made
And
now
that
I
am
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
I
have
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
Ooh-oh
