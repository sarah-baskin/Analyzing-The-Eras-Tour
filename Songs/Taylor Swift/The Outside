I
did
not
know
what
I
would
find
When
I
went
looking
for
a
reason,
I
know
I
did
not
read
between
the
lines
And,
baby,
I
have
got
nowhere
to
go
I
tried
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
by
But
nothing
seems
to
work
the
first
few
times
Am
I
right?
So
how
can
I
ever
try
to
be
better?
Nobody
ever
lets
me
in
I
can
still
see
you,
this
are
not
the
best
view
On
the
outside
looking
in
I
have
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
I
have
never
been
on
the
outside
You
saw
me
there,
but
never
knew
That
I
would
give
it
all
up
to
be
A
part
of
this,
a
part
of
you
And
now,
it
is
all
too
late,
so
you
see
You
could
have
helped
if
you
had
wanted
to
But
no
one
notices
until
it
is
too
late
to
do
anything
How
can
I
ever
try
to
be
better?
Nobody
ever
lets
me
in
I
can
still
see
you,
this
are
not
the
best
view
On
the
outside
looking
in
I
have
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
I
have
never
been
on
the
outside
Oh,
yeah
How
can
I
ever
try
to
be
better?
Nobody
ever
lets
me
in
And
I
can
still
see
you,
this
are
not
the
best
view
On
the
outside
looking
in
I
have
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
I
have
never
been
on
the
outside
Oh-oh
Oh,
oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
