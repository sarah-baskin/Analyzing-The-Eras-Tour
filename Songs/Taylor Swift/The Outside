did
n't
know
what
i
would
find
when

went
looking
for
a
reason
,
i

did
n't
read
between
the
lines
and
,
baby

've
got
nowhere
to
go

tried
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
by
but
nothing
seems
to
work
the
first
few
times

i
right
?
so

can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
?
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
,
this
ai
n't
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
i
've
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
've
never
been
on
the
outside
you
saw
me
there
,
but
never
knew
that
i
would
give
it
all
up
to
be
a
part
of
this
,
a
part
of
you
and
now
,
it
's
all
too
late
,
so
you
see
you
could
've
helped
if
you
had
wanted
to
but
no
one
notices
until
it
's
too
late
to
do
anything
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
?
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
,
