Drew
looks
at
me
I
fake
a
smile
so
he
will
not
see
That
I
want
and
I
am
needing
Everything
that
we
should
be
I
will
bet
she
is
beautiful,
that
girl
he
talks
about
And
she
is
got
everything
that
I
have
to
live
without
Drew
talks
to
me
I
laugh
because
it
is
just
so
funny
That
I
cannot
even
see
Anyone
when
he
is
with
me
He
says
he
is
so
in
love,
he
is
finally
got
it
right
I
wonder
if
he
knows
he
is
all
I
think
about
at
night
He's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
The
only
thing
that
keeps
me
wishin'
on
a
wishing
star
He's
the
song
in
the
car
I
keep
singing,
do
not
know
why
I
do
Drew
walks
by
me
Can
he
tell
that
I
cannot
breathe?
And
there
he
goes,
so
perfectly
The
kind
of
flawless
I
wish
I
could
be
She'd
better
hold
him
tight,
give
him
all
her
love
Look
in
those
beautiful
eyes
and
know
she
is
lucky
because
He's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
The
only
thing
that
keeps
me
wishin'
on
a
wishing
star
He's
the
song
in
the
car
I
keep
singing,
do
not
know
why
I
do
So
I
will
drive
home
alone
as
I
turn
off
the
light
I
will
put
his
picture
down
and
maybe
get
some
sleep
tonight
'Cause
he
is
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
The
only
one
who
is
got
enough
of
me
to
break
my
heart
He's
the
song
in
the
car
I
keep
singing,
do
not
know
why
I
do
He's
the
time
taken
up,
but
there
is
never
enough
And
he
is
all
that
I
need
to
fall
into
Drew
looks
at
me
I
fake
a
smile,
so
he
will
not
see
