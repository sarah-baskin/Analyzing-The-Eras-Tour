Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Why
would
you
want
to
take
Our
love
and
tear
it
all
apart
now?
Why
would
you
want
to
make
The
very
first
scar?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Maybe
I
should
have
seen
the
signs
Should've
read
the
writing
on
the
wall
And
realized
by
the
distance
in
your
eyes
That
I
would
be
the
one
to
fall
No
matter
what
you
say
I
still
cannot
believe
that
you
would
walk
away
It
do
not
make
sense
to
me,
but
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Why
would
you
want
to
take
Our
love
and
tear
it
all
apart
now?
Why
would
you
want
to
make
The
very
first
scar?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
It's
not
unbroken
anymore
(It's
not
unbroken
anymore)
How
do
I
get
it
back
the
way
it
was
before?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Why
would
you
want
to
take
Our
love
and
tear
it
all
apart
now?
Why
would
you
want
to
make
The
very
first
scar?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
-
(Why)
Would
you
want
to
break
it?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Why
would
you
want
to
take
Our
love
and
tear
it
all
apart
now?
Why
would
you
want
to
make
The
very
first
scar?
Why
would
you
want
to
break
A
perfectly
good
heart?
Mmm-hmm
