I
do
not
know
what
I
want,
so
do
not
ask
me
'Cause
I
am
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
Don't
know
what
is
down
this
road,
I
am
just
walking
Trying
to
see
through
the
rain
coming
down
Even
though
I
am
not
the
only
one
Who
feels
the
way
I
do
I
am
alone,
on
my
own,
and
that
is
all
I
know
I
will
be
strong,
I
will
be
wrong,
oh,
but
life
goes
on
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl
trying
to
find
a
place
in
this
world
Got
the
radio
on,
my
old
blue
jeans
And
I
am
wearing
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
Feeling
lucky
today,
got
the
sunshine
Could
you
tell
me
what
more
do
I
need?
And
tomorrow's
just
a
mystery,
oh,
yeah
But
that
is
okay
I
am
alone,
on
my
own,
and
that
is
all
I
know
I
will
be
strong,
I
will
be
wrong,
oh,
but
life
goes
on
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl
trying
to
find
a
place
in
this
world
Maybe
I
am
just
a
girl
on
a
mission
But
I
am
ready
to
fly
I
am
alone,
on
my
own,
and
that
is
all
I
know
I
will
be
strong,
I
will
be
wrong,
oh,
but
life
goes
on
Oh,
I
am
alone,
on
my
own,
and
that
is
all
I
know
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl
trying
to
find
a
place
in
this
world
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl,
oh,
oh
Oh,
I
am
just
a
girl
