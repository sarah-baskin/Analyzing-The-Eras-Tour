Cory's
eyes
are
like
a
jungle
He
smiles,
it
is
like
the
radio
He
whispers
songs
into
my
window
In
words
that
nobody
knows
There's
pretty
girls
on
every
corner
They
watch
him
as
he
is
walking
home
Saying,
"Does
he
know?"
Will
you
ever
know?
You're
beautiful,
every
little
piece,
love
Don't
you
know
you
are
really
going
to
be
someone?
Ask
anyone
And
when
you
find
everything
you
looked
for
I
hope
your
life
leads
you
back
to
my
door
Oh,
but
if
it
do
not
Stay
beautiful
Cory
finds
another
way
to
be
The
highlight
of
my
day
I
am
taking
pictures
in
my
mind
So
I
can
save
them
for
a
rainy
day
It's
hard
to
make
a
conversation
When
he
is
taking
my
breath
away
I
should
say,
"Hey,
by
the
way"
You're
beautiful,
every
little
piece,
love
Don't
you
know
you
are
really
going
to
be
someone?
Ask
anyone
And
when
you
find
everything
you
looked
for
I
hope
your
life
leads
you
back
to
my
door
Oh,
but
if
it
do
not
Stay
beautiful
If
you
and
I
are
a
story
That
never
gets
told
If
what
you
are
is
a
daydream
I
will
never
get
to
hold,
at
least
you
will
know
You're
beautiful,
every
little
piece,
love
Don't
you
know
you
are
really
going
to
be
someone?
Ask
anyone
And
when
you
find
everything
you
looked
for
I
hope
your
life
leads
you
back
to
my
front
door
Oh,
but
if
it
do
not
Will
you
stay
beautiful,
beautiful,
beautiful?
Beautiful,
beautiful,
beautiful
La-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh,
but
if
it
do
not
Stay
beautiful,
stay
beautiful
Na-na-na,
na-na
