cory
's
eyes
are
like
a
jungle
he
smiles
,
it
's
like
the
radio
he
whispers
songs
into
my
window
in
words
that
nobody
knows
there
's
pretty
girls
on
every
corner
they
watch
him
as
he
's
walking
home
saying
,
``
does
he
know
?
''
will
you
ever
know
?
you
're
beautiful
,
every
little
piece
,
love
do
n't
you
know
you
're
really
gon
na
be
someone
?

anyone
and
when
you
find
everything
you

another
way
to

the
highlight
of
my
day
i
'm
taking
pictures
in
my
mind
so
i
can
save
'em
for
a
rainy
day

's
hard
to
make
a
conversation
when

's
taking
my
breath
away

should
say
,
``

the
way
