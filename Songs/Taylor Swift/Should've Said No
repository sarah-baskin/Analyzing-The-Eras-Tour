It's
strange
to
think
the
songs
we
used
to
sing
The
smiles,
the
flowers,
everything
is
gone
Yesterday,
I
found
out
about
you
Even
now,
just
lookin'
at
you
feels
wrong
You
say
that
you
would
take
it
all
back
Given
one
chance
It
was
a
moment
of
weakness
And
you
said
yes
You
should
have
said
no,
you
should
have
gone
home
You
should
have
thought
twice
'fore
you
let
it
all
go
You
should
have
known
that
word
'Bout
what
you
did
with
her'd
get
back
to
me
(Get
back
to
me)
And
I
should
have
been
there
in
the
back
of
your
mind
I
should
not
be
asking
myself
why
You
should
not
be
begging
for
forgiveness
at
my
feet
You
should
have
said
no
Baby,
and
you
might
still
have
me
You
can
see
that
I
have
been
cryin'
And
baby,
you
know
all
the
right
things
to
say
But
do
you
honestly
expect
me
to
believe
We
could
ever
be
the
same?
You
say
that
the
past
is
the
past
You
need
one
chance
It
was
a
moment
of
weakness
And
you
said
yes
You
should
have
said
no,
you
should
have
gone
home
You
should
have
thought
twice
'fore
you
let
it
all
go
You
should
have
known
that
word
'Bout
what
you
did
with
her'd
get
back
to
me
(Get
back
to
me)
And
I
should
have
been

in
the
back
of
your
mind
I
should
not
be
asking
myself
why
You
should
not
be
begging
for
forgiveness
at
my
feet
You
should
have
said
no
Baby,
and
you
might
still
have
me
Oh,
oh
I
cannot
resist
Before
you
go,
tell
me
this
Was
it
worth
it?
Was
she
worth
this?
No,
no
No,
no,
no,
no
You
should
have
said
no,
you
should
have
gone
home
You
should
have
thought
twice
'fore
you
let
it
all
go
You
should
have
known
that
word
'Bout
what
you
did
with
