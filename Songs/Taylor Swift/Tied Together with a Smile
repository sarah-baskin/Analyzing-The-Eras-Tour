Seems
the
only
one
who
does
not
see
your
beauty
Is
the
face
in
the
mirror
looking
back
at
you
You
walk
around
here
thinking
you
are
not
pretty
But
that
is
not
true
'Cause
I
know
you
Hold
on,
baby,
you
are
losing
it
The
water's
high,
you
are
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
And
no
one
knows
That
you
cry,
but
you
do
not
tell
anyone
That
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
And
you
are
tied
together
with
a
smile
But
you
are
coming
undone,
oh
I
guess
it
is
true
that
love
was
all
you
wanted
'Cause
you
are
giving
it
away
like
it
is
extra
change
Hoping
it
will
end
up
in
his
pocket
(Pocket)
But
he
leaves
you
out
like
a
penny
in
the
rain
Oh,
because
it
is
not
his
price
to
pay
It's
not
his
price
to
pay
Hold
on,
baby,
you
are
losing
it
The
water's
high,
you
are
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
And
no
one
knows
That
you
cry,
but
you
do
not
tell
anyone
That
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
And
you
are
tied
together
with
a
smile
But
you
are
coming
undone,
oh
Oh,
oh
Hold
on,
baby,
you
are
losing
it
The
water's
high,
you
are
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
And
no
one
knows
That
you
cry
but
you
do
not
tell
anyone
That
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
And
you
are
tied
together
with
a
smile
But
you
are
coming
undone,
oh
You're
tied
together
with
a
smile
But
you
are
coming
undone,
oh,
oh-oh
Goodbye,
baby
With
a
smile,
baby,
baby
Oh
