seems
the
only
one
who
does
n't
see
your
beauty
is
the
face
in
the
mirror
looking
back
at
you
you
walk
around
here
thinking
you
're
not
pretty
but
that
's
not
true
'cause
i
know
you
hold
on
,
baby
,
you
're
losing
it
the
water
's
high
,
you
're
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
and
no
one
knows
that
you
cry
,
but
you
do
n't
tell
anyone
that
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
and
you
're
tied
together
with
a
smile
but
you
're
coming
undone
,
oh
i
guess
it
's
true
that
love
was
all
you
wanted
'cause
you
're
giving
it
away
like
it
's
extra
change
hoping
it
will
end
up
in
his
pocket
(
pocket
)
but
he
leaves
you
out
like
a
penny
in
the
rain
oh
,
'cause
it
's
not
his
price
to
pay
it
's
not
his
price
to
pay
hold
on
,
baby
,
you
're
losing
it
the
water
's
high
,
you
're
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
and
no
one
knows
that
you
