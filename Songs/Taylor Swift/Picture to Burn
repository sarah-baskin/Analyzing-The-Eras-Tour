State
the
obvious,
I
did
not
get
my
perfect
fantasy
I
realize
you
love
yourself
more
than
you
could
ever
love
me
So
go
and
tell
your
friends
that
I
am
obsessive
and
crazy
That's
fine,
you
will
not
mind
if
I
say
By
the
way
I
hate
that
stupid
old
pickup
truck
you
never
let
me
drive
You're
a
redneck
heartbreak
who
is
really
bad
at
lyin'
So
watch
me
strike
a
match
on
all
my
wasted
time
As
far
as
I
am
concerned,
you
are
just
another
picture
to
burn
There's
no
time
for
tears,
I
am
just
sittin'
here
planning
my
revenge
There's
nothing
stoppin'
me
from
goin'
out
with
all
of
your
best
friends
And
if
you
come
around
sayin'
sorry
to
me
My
daddy's
going
to
show
ya
how
sorry
you
will
be
'Cause
I
hate
that
stupid
old
pickup
truck
you
never
let
me
drive
You're
a
redneck
heartbreak
who
is
really
bad
at
lyin'
So
watch
me
strike
a
match
on
all
my
wasted
time
As
far
as
I
am
concerned,
you
are
just
another
picture
to
burn
And
if
you
are
missing
me,
you
would
better
keep
it
to
yourself
'Cause
coming
back
around
here
would
be
bad
for
your
health
'Cause
I
hate
that
stupid
old
pickup
truck
you
never
let
me
drive
You're
a
redneck
heartbreak
who
is
really
bad
at
lyin'
So
watch
me
strike
a
match
on
all
my
wasted
time
In
case
you
have
not
heard
I
really,
really
hate
that
stupid
old
pickup
truck
you
never
let
me
drive
You're
a
redneck
heartbreak
who
is
really
bad
at
lyin'
So
watch
me
strike
a
match
on
all
my
wasted
time
As
far
as
I
am
concerned,
you
are
just
another
picture
to
burn
Burn,
burn,
burn,
baby,
burn
You're
just
another
picture
to
burn
Baby,
burn
