she
said
i
was
seven
and
you
were
nine
i
looked
at
you
like
the
stars
that
shined
in
the
sky
,
the
pretty
lights
and
our
daddies
used
to
joke
about
the
two
of
us
growing
up
and
falling
in
love
and
our
mamas
smiled
and
rolled
their
eyes
and
said
,
``
oh
,
my
,
my
,
my
''
take
me
back
to
the
house
in
the
backyard
tree

you
'd
beat
me
up
,
you
were
bigger
than
me
you
never
did
,
you
never
did
take
me
back
when
our
world
was
one
block
wide
i
dared
you
to
kiss
me
and
ran
when
you
tried
just
two
kids
,
you
and
i
oh
,
my
,
my
,
my
,
my
well
,
i
was
sixteen
when
suddenly
i
was
n't
that
little
girl
you
used
to
see
but
your
eyes
still
shined
like
pretty
lights
and
our
daddies
used
to
joke
about
the
two
of
us
they
never
believed
we
'd
really
fall
in
love
and
our
mamas
smiled
and
rolled
their
eyes
and
said
,
``
oh
,
my
,
my
,
my
''
take
me
back
to
the
creek
beds
we
turned
up

riding
in
your
truck
and
all
i
need
is
you
next
to
me
take
me
back
to
the
time
we
had
our
very
first
fight
the
slamming
of
doors
'stead
of
kissing
goodnight
you
stayed
outside
'til
the
morning
light
oh
,
my
,
my
,
my
,
my
a
few
years
had
gone
and
come
around
we
were
sitting
at
our
favorite
spot
in
town
and
you
looked
at
me
,
got
down
on
one
knee
take
me
back
to
the
time
when
we
walked
down
the
aisle
our
whole
town
came
and
our
mamas
cried
you
said
,
``
i
do
,
''
and
i
did
,
too
take
me
home
where
we
met
so
many
years
before
we
'll
rock
our
babies
on
that
very
front
porch
after
all
this
time
,
you
and
i
and
i
'll
be
eighty-seven
,
you
'll
be
eighty-nine
i
'll
still
look
at
you
like
the
stars
that
shine
in
the
sky
,
oh
,
my
,
my
,
my
