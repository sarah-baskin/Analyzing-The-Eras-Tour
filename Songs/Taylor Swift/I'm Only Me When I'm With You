Friday
night
beneath
the
stars
In
a
field
behind
your
yard
You
and
I
are
painting
pictures
in
the
sky
And
sometimes,
we
do
not
say
a
thing
Just
listen
to
the
crickets
sing
Everything
I
need
is
right
here
by
my
side
And
I
know
everything
about
you
I
do
not
want
to
live
without
you
I
am
only
up
when
you
are
not
down
Don't
want
to
fly
if
you
are
still
on
the
ground
It's
like
no
matter
what
I
do
Well,
you
drive
me
crazy
half
the
time
The
other
half,
I
am
only
tryin'
to
Let
you
know
that
what
I
feel
is
true
And
I
am
only
me
when
I
am
with
you
Just
a
small-town
boy
and
girl
Livin'
in
a
crazy
world
Tryna
figure
out
what
is
and
is
not
true
And
I
do
not
try
to
hide
my
tears
My
secrets
or
my
deepest
fears
Through
it
all,
nobody
gets
me
like
you
do
And
you
know
everything
about
me
You
say
that
you
cannot
live
without
me
I
am
only
up
when
you
are
not
down
Don't
want
to
fly
if
you
are
still
on
the
ground
It's
like
no
matter
what
I
do
Well,
you
drive
me
crazy
half
the
time
The
other
half,
I
am
only
tryin'
to
Let
you
know
that
what
I
feel
is
true
And
I
am
only
me
when
I
am
with
you
When
I
am
with
anybody
else
It's
so
hard
to
be
myself
And
only
you
can
tell
That
I
am
only
up
when
you
are
not
down
Don't
want
to
fly
if
you
are
still
on
the
ground
It's
like
no
matter
what
I
do
Well,
you
drive
me
crazy
half
the
time
The
other
half,
I
am
only
tryin'
to
Let
you
know
that
what
I
feel
is
true
And
I
am
only
me
Who
I
want
to
be
Well,
I
am
only
me
when
I
am
with
you
With
you
Uh-huh-huh,
yeah
