Midnight
You
come
and
pick
me
up,
no
headlights
Long
drive
Could
end
in
burnin'
flames
or
paradise
Fade
into
view,
oh
It's
been
a
while
since
I
have
even
heard
from
you
(Heard
from
you)
I
should
just
tell
you
to
leave
because
I
Know
exactly
where
it
leads,
but
I
Watch
us
go
'round
and
'round
each
time
You
got
that
James
Dean
daydream
look
in
your
eye
And
I
got
that
red
lip
classic
thing
that
you
like
And
when
we
go
crashin'
down,
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style,
we
never
go
out
of
style
You
got
that
long
hair,
slicked
back,
white
T-shirt
And
I
got
that
good
girl
faith
and
a
tight
little
skirt
And
when
we
go
crashin'
down,
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style,
we
never
go
out
of
style
So
it
goes
He
cannot
keep
his
wild
eyes
on
the
road,
mm
Takes
me
home
Lights
are
off,
he
is
taking
off
his
coat,
oh,
yeah
I
say,
"I
heard,
oh
That
you
have
been
out
and
about
with
some
other
girl"
Some
other
girl
He
says,
"What
you
heard
is
true,
but
I
Can't
stop
thinkin'
'bout
you,"
and
I
I
said,
"I've
been
there
too
a
few
times"
'Cause
you
got
that
James
Dean
daydream
look
in
your
eye
And
I
got
that
red
lip
classic
thing
that
you
like
And
when
we
go
crashin'
down,
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style,
we
never
go
out
of
style
You
got
that
long
hair,
slicked
back,
white
T-shirt
And
I
got
that
good
girl
faith
and
a
tight
little
skirt
(A
tight
little
skirt)
And
when
we
go
crashin'
down,
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style
(We
never
go,
we
never
go),
we
never
go
out
of
style
Take
me
home
(Ah)
Just
take
me
home
(Ah)
Yeah,
just
take
me
home
(Ah)
Woah,
woah,
oh
(Out
of
style)
Oh,
because
you
got
that
James
Dean
daydream
look
in
your
eye
And
I
got
that
red
lip
classic
thing
that
you
like
And
when
we
go
crashin'
down
(And
when
we
go),
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style,
we
never
go
out
of
style
