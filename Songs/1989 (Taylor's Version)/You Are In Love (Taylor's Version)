you

it
back
buttons
on

coat
,
lighthearted
joke
no
proof
,
not
much
,
but
you
saw
enough
small
talk
,
he
drives
,
coffee
at
midnight
the
light
reflects
the
chain
on
your
neck
he
says
,
``
look
up
''
and
your
shoulders
brush
no
proof
,
one
touch
,
but
you
felt
enough
you
can
hear
it
in
the
silence
(

morning
,
his
place
,
burnt
toast
,
sunday
you
keep
his
shirt
,
he
keeps
his
word
and
for
once
,
you
let
go
of
your
fears
and
your
ghosts
one
step
,
not
much
,
but
it
said
enough
you
kiss
on
sidewalks
,
you
fight
,
then
you
talk
one
night
,
he
wakes
,
strange
look
on
his
face
pauses
,
then
says
,
``
you
're
my
best
friend
''
and
you
knew
what
it
was
,
he
is
in

goes
you
two
are
dancing
in
a
snow
globe
'round

'round
and
he
keeps
a
picture
of
you
in
his
office
downtown
and
you
understand
now
why
they
lost
their
minds
and
fought
the
wars
and
why
i
've
spent
my
whole
life
trying

put
it
into
