Walkin'
through
a
crowd,
the
village
is
aglow
Kaleidoscope
of
loud
heartbeats
under
coats
Everybody
here
wanted
somethin'
more
Searchin'
for
a
sound
we
had
not
heard
before
And
it
said
"Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you"
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
It's
a
new
soundtrack,
I
could
dance
to
this
beat,
beat
forevermore
The
lights
are
so
bright,
but
they
never
blind
me,
me
Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
When
we
first
dropped
our
bags
on
apartment
floors
Took
our
broken
hearts,
put
them
in
a
drawer
Everybody
here
was
someone
else
before
And
you
can
want
who
you
want
Boys
and
boys
and
girls
and
girls
Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
It's
a
new
soundtrack,
I
could
dance
to
this
beat,
beat
forevermore
The
lights
are
so
bright,
but
they
never
blind
me,
me
Welcome
to
New
York
(New
York),
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome
to
New
York,
welcome
to
New
York
Like
any
great
love,
it
keeps
you
guessing
Like
any
real
love,
it
is
ever-changing
Like
any
true
love,
it
drives
you
crazy
But
you
know
you
would
not
change
anything,
anything,
anything
Welcome
to
New
York,
it
is
been
waitin'
for
you
Welcome

New
York,
