Nice
to
meet
you,
where
you
been?
I
could
show
you
incredible
things
Magic,
madness,
heaven,
sin
Saw
you
there
and
I
thought
"Oh,
my
God,
look
at
that
face
You
look
like
my
next
mistake
Love's
a
game,
want
to
play?"
Ayy
New
money,
suit
and
tie
I
can
read
you
like
a
magazine
Ain't
it
funny?
Rumors
fly
And
I
know
you
heard
about
me
So,
hey,
let
us
be
friends
I
am
dyin'
to
see
how
this
one
ends
Grab
your
passport
and
my
hand
I
can
make
the
bad
guys
good
for
a
weekend
So
it
is
going
to
be
forever
Or
it
is
going
to
go
down
in
flames?
You
can
tell
me
when
it
is
over,
mm
If
the
high
was
worth
the
pain
Got
a
long
list
of
ex-lovers
They'll
tell
you
I
am
insane
'Cause
you
know
I
love
the
players
And
you
love
the
game
'Cause
we
are
young
and
we
are
reckless
We'll
take
this
way
too
far
It'll
leave
you
breathless,
mm
Or
with
a
nasty
scar
Got
a
long
list
of
ex-lovers
They'll
tell
you
I
am
insane
But
I
have
got
a
blank
space,
baby
And
I
will
write
your
name
Cherry
lips,
crystal
skies
I
could
show
you
incredible
things
Stolen
kisses,
pretty
lies
You're
the
king,
baby,
I
am
your
queen
Find
out
what
you
want
Be
that
girl
for
a
month
Wait,
the
worst
is
yet
to
come,
oh,
no
Screaming,
crying,
perfect
storms
I
can
make
all
the
tables
turn
Rose
garden
filled
with
thorns
Keep
you
second
guessin',
like
"Oh,
my
God,
who
is
she?"
I
get
drunk
on
jealousy
But
you
will
come
back
each
time
you
leave
'Cause,
darling,
I
am
a
nightmare
dressed
like
a
daydream
So
it
is
going
to
be
forever
Or
it
is
going
to
go
down
in
flames?
You
can
tell
me
when
it
is

(Insane)
But
I
have
got
a
blank
space,
baby
And
I
will
write
your
name
Boys
only
want
love
if
it
is
torture
Don't
say
I
didn't,
say
I
did
not
warn
ya
