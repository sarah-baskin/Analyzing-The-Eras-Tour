once
the
flight
had
flown
(
uh-huh
)
with
the
wilt
of
the
rose
(
uh-huh
)
i
slept
all
alone
(
uh-huh
)
you
still
would
n't
go
let
's
fast
forward
to
three
hundred
takeout
coffees
later
i
see
your
profile
and
your
smile
on
unsuspecting
waiters
you
dream
of
my
mouth
before
it
called
you
a
lying
traitor
you
search
in
every
maiden
's
bed
for
somethin
'
greater
,
baby
was
it
over
when
she
laid
down
on
your
couch
?
was
it
over
when
he
unbuttoned
my
blouse
?
``
come
here
,
''
i
whispered
in
your
ear
in
your
dream
as
you
passed
out
,
baby
was
it
over
then
?
and
is
it
over
now

(

you
lost
control
(
uh-huh

red
blood
,
white
snow
(
uh-huh
)
blue
dress
on
a
boat
(
uh-huh
)
your
new
girl
is
my
clone
and
did
you
think
i
did
n't
see
you
?
there
were
flashin
'
lights
at
least
i
had
the
decency
to
keep
my
nights
out
of
sight
only
rumors
'bout
my
hips
and
thighs
and
my
whispered
sighs
oh
,
lord
,
i
think
about
jumpin
'
off
of
very
tall
somethings
just
to
see
you
come
runnin
'
and
say
the
one
thing
i
've
been
wanting
,

no
let
's
fast
forward
to
three
hundred
awkward
blind
dates
later
(
oh
)
if
she
's
got
blue
eyes
,
i
will
surmise
that
you
'll
probably
date
her
(
oh
,
no
)
you
dream
of
my
mouth
before
it
called
you
a
