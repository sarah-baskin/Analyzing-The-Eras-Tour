(Hey,

(Hey,

(Hey,
hey,

People
like
you
always
want
back
The
love
they
gave
away
And
people
like
me
want
to
believe
you
When
you
say
you
have
changed
The
more
I
think
about
it
now
The
less
I
know
All
I
know
is
that
you
drove
us
Off
the
road
(Stay)
Hey,
all
you
had
to
do
was
stay
Had
me
in
the
palm
of
your
hand,
then
Why'd
you
have
to
go
and
lock
me
out
when
I
let
you
in?
(Stay)
Hey,
now
you
say
you
want
it
back
Now
that
it
is
just
too
late,
well,
could
have
been
easy
All
you
had
to
do
was
(Stay)
All
you
had
to
do
was

All
you

All

(Stay)
All
you
had
to
do
was
stay
Here
you
are
now,
callin'
me
up
But
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
I
have
been
pickin'
up
the
pieces
Of
the
mess
you
made
People
like
you
always
want
back
The
love
they
pushed
aside
But
people
like
me
are
gone
forever
When
you
say
goodbye
(Stay)
Hey,
all
you
had
to
do
was
stay
Had
me
in
the
palm
of
your

Why'd

(Stay,

Let
me
remind
you
This
was
what
you
wanted
(Oh,
oh,
oh-oh-oh)
You
ended
it
You
were
all
I
wanted
(Oh,

But
not
like
this
Not
like
this,

Oh,
