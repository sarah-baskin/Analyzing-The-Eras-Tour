you
had
people
who
called
you
on
unmarked
numbers
in
my
peripheral
vision
i
let
it
slide
like
a
hose
on
a
slippery
plastic
summer
all
was
quickly
forgiven
you
were
so
magnetic
,
it
was
almost
obnoxious
flush
with
the
currency
of
cool
i
was
always
turnin
'
out
my
empty
pockets
and
when
it
came
to
you
i
did
n't
come
here
to
make
friends
we
were
born
to
be
suburban
legends
when
you
hold
me
,
it
holds
me
together
and
you
kiss
me
in
a
way
that
's
gon
na
screw
me
up
forever
i
had
the
fantasy
that
maybe
our
mismatched
star
signs
would
surprise
the
whole
school
when
i
ended
up
back
at
our
class
reunion
walkin
'
in
with
you
you
'd
be
more
than
a
chapter
in
my
old
diaries
with
the
pages
ripped
out
i
am
standin
'
in
a
1950s
gymnasium
and
i
can
still
see
you
now
i
did
n't
come
here
to
make
friends
we
were
born
to
be
suburban
legends
when
you
hold
me
,
it
holds
me
together
and
you
kiss
me
in
a
way
that
's
gon
na
screw
me
up
forever
i
know
that
you
still
remember
we
were
born
to
be
national
treasures
when
you
told
me
we
'd
get
back
together
and
you
kissed
me
in
a
way
that
's
gon
na
screw
me
up
forever
tick-tock
on
the
clock
,
i
pace
down
your
block
i
broke
my
own
heart
'cause
you
were
too
polite
to
do
it
waves
crash
on
the
shore
,
i
dash
to
the
door
you
do
n't
knock
anymore
and
my
whole
life
's
ruined
