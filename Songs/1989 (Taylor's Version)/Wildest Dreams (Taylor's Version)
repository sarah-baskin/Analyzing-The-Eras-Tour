He
said,
"Let's
get
out
of
this
town
Drive
out
of
the
city,
away
from
the
crowds"
I
thought,
"Heaven
cannot
help
me
now"
Nothing
lasts
forever
But
this
is
going
to
take
me
down
He's
so
tall
and
handsome
as
hell
He's
so
bad,
but
he
does
it
so
well
I
can
see
the
end
as
it
begins
My
one
condition
is
Say
you
will
remember
me
Standin'
in
a
nice
dress
Starin'
at
the
sunset,
babe
Red
lips
and
rosy
cheeks
Say
you
will
see
me
again
Even
if
it
is
just
in
your
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
I
said,
"No
one
has
to
know
what
we
do"
His
hands
are
in
my
hair,
his
clothes
are
in
my
room
And
his
voice
is
a
familiar
sound
Nothin'
lasts
forever
But
this
is
gettin'
good
now
He's
so
tall
and
handsome
as
hell
He's
so
bad,
but
he
does
it
so
well
And
when
we
have
had
our
very
last
kiss
My
last
request
it
is
Say
you
will
remember
me
Standin'
in
a
nice
dress
Starin'
at
the
sunset,
babe
Red
lips
and
rosy
cheeks
Say
you
will
see
me
again
Even
if
it
is
just
in
your
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
(Ha,
ha)
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
You'll
see
me
in
hindsight
Tangled
up
with
you
all
night
Burnin'
it
down
Someday,
when
you
leave
me
I
bet
these
memories
Follow
you
around
You'll
see
me
in
hindsight
Tangled
up
with
you
all
night
Burnin'
(Burnin')
it
(It)
down
(Down)
Someday,
when
you
leave
me
I
bet
these
memories
Follow
(Follow)
you
(You)
around
(Around)
(Follow
you
around)
Say
you
will
remember
me
Standing
in
a
nice
dress
Starin'
at
the
sunset,
babe
Red
lips
and
rosy
cheeks
Say
you
will
see
me
again
Even
if
it
is
just
pretend
Say
you
will
remember
me
Standin'
in
a
nice
dress
Starin'
at
the
sunset,
babe
Red
lips
and
rosy
cheeks
Say
you
will
see
me
again
Even
if
it
is
just
in
your
(Just
pretend,
just
pretend)
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
(Ah-ah)
Wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
Even
if
it
is
just
in
your
In
your
wildest
dreams,
ah,
ha
In
your
wildest
dreams,
ah,
