the
drought
was
the
very
worst
,
ah-ah
,
ah-ah
when
the
flowers
that
we
'd
grown
together
died
of
thirst
it
was
months
and
months
of
back
and
forth
,
ah-ah
,
ah-ah
you
're
still
all
over
me
like
a
wine-stained
dress
i
ca
n't
wear
anymore
hung
my
head
as
i
lost
the
war
and
the
sky
turned
black
like
a
perfect
storm
the
rain
came
pouring
down
when
i
was
drownin
'
,
that
's
when
i
could
finally
breathe
and
by
mornin
'
,
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
there
was
nothin
'
left
to
do
,
ah-ah
,
ah-ah
when
the
butterflies
turned
to
dust
that
covered
my
whole
room
so
i
punched
a
hole
in
the
roof
,
ah-ah
,
ah-ah
let
the
flood
carry
away
all
my
pictures
of
you
the
water
filled
my
lungs
i
screamed
so
loud
,
but
no
one
heard
a
thing
the
rain
came
pourin
'
down
when
i
was
drownin
'
,
that
's
when
i
could
finally
breathe
and
by
mornin
'
,
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
i
think
i
