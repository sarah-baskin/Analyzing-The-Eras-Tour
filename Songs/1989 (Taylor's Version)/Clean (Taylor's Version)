The
drought
was
the
very
worst,
ah-ah,
ah-ah
When
the
flowers
that
we
would
grown
together
died
of
thirst
It
was
months
and
months
of
back
and
forth,
ah-ah,
ah-ah
You're
still
all
over
me
like
a
wine-stained
dress
I
cannot
wear
anymore
Hung
my
head
as
I
lost
the
war
And
the
sky
turned
black
like
a
perfect
storm
The
rain
came
pouring
down
When
I
was
drownin',
that
is
when
I
could
finally
breathe
And
by
mornin',
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
There
was
nothin'
left
to
do,
ah-ah,
ah-ah
When
the
butterflies
turned
to
dust
that
covered
my
whole
room
So
I
punched
a
hole
in
the
roof,
ah-ah,
ah-ah
Let
the
flood
carry
away
all
my
pictures
of
you
The
water
filled
my
lungs
I
screamed
so
loud,
but
no
one
heard
a
thing
The
rain
came
pourin'
down
When
I
was
drownin',
that
is
when
I
could
finally
breathe
And
by
mornin',
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
Ah-ah-ah
Ten
months
sober,
I
must
admit
Just
because
you
are
clean,
do
not
mean
you
do
not
miss
it
Ten
months
older,
I
will
not
give
in
Now
that
I
am
clean,
I
am
never
going
to
risk
it
The
drought
was
the
very
worst,
ah-ah,
ah-ah
When
the
flowers
that
we
would
grown
together
died
of
thirst
The
rain
came
pourin'
down
When
I
was
drownin',
that
is
when
I
could
finally
breathe
And
by
mornin',
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
The
rain
came
pourin'
down
When
I
was
drownin',
that
is
when
I
could
finally
breathe
And
by
mornin',
gone
was
any
trace
of
you
I
think
I
am
finally
clean
Finally
clean
Think
I
am
finally
clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Think
I
am
finally
clean
