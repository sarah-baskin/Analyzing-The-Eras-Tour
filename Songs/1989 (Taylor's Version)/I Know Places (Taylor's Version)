I-I-I-I,
I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I,
I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I,
I-I-I-I,
I-I
(I,
I)
You
stand
with
your
hand
on
my
waistline
It's
a
scene
and
we
are
out
here
in
plain
sight
I
can
hear
them
whisper
as
we
pass
by
It's
a
bad
sign,
bad
sign
Somethin'
happens
when
everybody
finds
out
See
the
vultures
circlin',
dark
clouds
Love's
a
fragile
little
flame,
it
could
burn
out
It
could
burn
out
'Cause
they
got
the
cages,
they
got
the
boxes
and
guns
They
are
the
hunters,
we
are
the
foxes
and
we
run
Baby,
I
know
places
we
will
not
be
found
And
they
will
be
chasing
their
tails
tryin'
to
track
us
down
'Cause
I,
I
know
places
we
can
hide
I
know
places,
I
know
places
Lights
flash
and
we
will
run
for
the
fences
Let
them
say
what
they
want,
we
will
not
hear
it
Loose
lips
sink
ships
all
the
damn
time
Not
this
time
Just
grab
my
hand
and
do
not
ever
drop
it,
my
love
They
are
the
hunters,
we
are
the
foxes
and
we
run
Baby
(Baby),
I
know
places
we
will
not
be
found
And
they
will
(They'll)
be
(Be)
chasing
their
tails
tryin'
to
track
us
down
'Cause
I,
I
know
places
we
can
hide
I
know
places
They
are
the
hunters,
we
are
the
foxes
and
we
run
Just
grab
my
hand
and
do
not
ever
drop
it,
my
love
Baby
(Baby),
I
know
places
we
will
not
be
found
And
they
will
(They'll)
be
(Be)
chasing
their
tails
tryin'
to
track
us
down
'Cause
I,
I
know
places
we
can
hide
I
know
places
(I)
They
take
their
shots,
but
we
are
bulletproof
(I
know
places)
(Hide)
And
you
know,
for
me,
it
is
always
you
(I
know
places)
(I)
In
the
dead
of
night,
your
eyes
so
green
(I
know
places)
(Hide)
And
I
know,
for
you,
it
is
always
me
(I
know
places)
I-I-I-I,
I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I,
I-I-I-I
(I,
I)
