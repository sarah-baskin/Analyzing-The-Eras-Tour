I
have
known
it
from
the
very
start
We're
a
shot
in
the
darkest
dark
Oh
no,
oh
no,
I
am
unarmed
The
waiting
is
a
sadness
Fading
into
madness
Oh
no,
oh
no,
it
will
not
stop
I
am
standin'
on
a
tightrope
alone
I
hold
my
breath
a
little
bit
longer
Halfway
out
the
door,
but
it
will
not
close
I
am
holdin'
out
hope
for
you
to
Say,
"Don't
go"
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
say,
"Don't
go"
Why'd
you
have
to
lead
me
on?
Why'd
you
have
to
twist
the
knife?
Walk
away
and
leave
me
bleedin',
bleedin'?
Why'd
you
whisper
in
the
dark
Just
to
leave
me
in
the
night?
Now
your
silence
has
me
screamin',
screamin'
(Say)
Say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
(Say)
say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
(Say,
say,
say,
say)
Now
I
am
pacin'
on
shaky
ground
Strike
a
match,
then
you
blow
it
out
Oh
no,
oh
no,
it
is
not
fair
'Cause
you
kiss
me
and
it
stops
time
And
I
am
yours,
but
you
are
not
mine
Oh
no,
oh
no,
you
are
not
there
I
am
standin'
on
the
sidewalk
alone
I
wait
for
you
to
drive
by
I
am
tryna
see
the
cards
that
you
will
not
show
I
am
about
to
fold
unless
you
(Say)
Say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
(Say)
say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
Why'd
you
have
to
lead
me
on?
Why'd
you
have
to
twist
the
knife?
Walk
away
and
leave
me
bleedin',
bleedin'?
Why'd
you
whisper
in
the
dark
Just
to
leave
me
in
the
night?
Now
your
silence
has
me
screamin',
screamin'
(Say)
Say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
(Say)
say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
(Say,
say,
say,
say)
Why'd
you
have
to
(Why'd
you
have
to)
Make
me
want
you?
(Make
me
want
you)
Why'd
you
have
to
(Why'd
you
have
to)
Give
me
nothin'
back?
Why'd
you
have
to
(Why'd
you
have
to)
Make
me
love
you?
(Make
me
love
you)
I
said,
"I
love
you"
(I
said,
"I
love
you")
You
say
nothin'
back
Why'd
you
have
to
lead
me
on?
(Oh)
Why'd
you
have
to
twist
the
knife?
Walk
away
and
leave
me
bleedin',
bleedin'?
Why'd
you
whisper
in
the
dark
Just
to
leave
me
in
the
night?
Now
your
silence
has
me
screamin',
screamin'
(Say)
Say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go"
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
(Say)
say,
"(Don't)
do
not
(Go)
go,"
woah
(Say,
say,
say,
say)
But
you
won't,
but
you
won't,
but
you
will
not
I
would
stay
forever
if
you
say,
"Don't
go"
But
you
won't,
but
you
won't,
but
you
will
not
