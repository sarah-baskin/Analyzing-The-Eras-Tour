you
went
to
a
party
i
heard
from
everybody
you
part
the
crowd
like
the
red
sea
do
n't
even
get
me
started
did
you
get
anxious
though
on
the
way
home
?
i
guess
i
'll
never
,
ever
know
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
you
grew
your
hair
long
you
got
new
icons
and
from
the
outside
it
looks
like
you
're
tryin
'
lives
on
i
miss
the
old
ways
you
did
n't
have
to
change
but
i
guess
i
do
n't
have
a
say
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
i
call
my
mom
,
she
said
that
it
was
for
the
best
remind
myself
,
the
more
i
gave
,
you
'd
want
me
less
i
can
not
be
your
friend
,
so
i
pay
the
price
of
what
i
lost
and
what
it
cost
,
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
what
do
you
tell
your
friends
we
shared
dinners
,
long
weekends
with
?
truth
is
,
i
ca
n't
pretend
it
's
platonic
,
it
's
just
ended
,
so
i
call
my
mom
,
she
said
to
get
it
off
my
chest
(
off
my
chest
)
remind
myself
the
way
you
faded
'til
i
left
(
until
i
left
)
i
can
not
be
your
friend
,
so
i
pay
the
price
of
what
i
lost
(
of
what
i
lost
)
and
what
it
cost
,
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
i
do
n't
have
to
pretend
i
like
acid
rock
or
that
i
'd
like
to
be
on
a
mega
yacht
with
important
men
who
think
important
thoughts
guess
maybe
i
am
better
off
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
and
the
only
way
back
to
my
dignity
was
to
turn
into
a
shrouded
mystery
just
like
i
had
been
when
you
were
chasing
me
guess
this
is
how
it
has
to
be
now
that
we
do
n't
talk
