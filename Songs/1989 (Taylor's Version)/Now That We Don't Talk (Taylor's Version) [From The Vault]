You
went
to
a
party
I
heard
from
everybody
You
part
the
crowd
like
the
Red
Sea
Don't
even
get
me
started
Did
you
get
anxious
though
On
the
way
home?
I
guess
I
will
never,
ever
know
Now
that
we
do
not
talk
You
grew
your
hair
long
You
got
new
icons
And
from
the
outside
It
looks
like
you
are
tryin'
lives
on
I
miss
the
old
ways
You
did
not
have
to
change
But
I
guess
I
do
not
have
a
say
Now
that
we
do
not
talk
I
call
my
mom,
she
said
that
it
was
for
the
best
Remind
myself,
the
more
I
gave,
you
would
want
me
less
I
cannot
be
your
friend,
so
I
pay
the
price
of
what
I
lost
And
what
it
cost,
now
that
we
do
not
talk
What
do
you
tell
your
friends
we
Shared
dinners,
long
weekends
with?
Truth
is,
I
cannot
pretend
it
is
Platonic,
it
is
just
ended,
so
I
call
my
mom,
she
said
to
get
it
off
my
chest
(Off
my
chest)
Remind
myself
the
way
you
faded
'til
I
left
(Until
I
left)
I
cannot
be
your
friend,
so
I
pay
the
price
of
what
I
lost
(Of
what
I
lost)
And
what
it
cost,
now
that
we
do
not
talk
I
do
not
have
to
pretend
I
like
acid
rock
Or
that
I
would
like
to
be
on
a
mega
yacht
With
important
men
who
think
important
thoughts
Guess
maybe
I
am
better
off
now
that
we
do
not
talk
And
the
only
way
back
to
my
dignity
Was
to
turn
into
a
shrouded
mystery
Just
like
I
had
been
when
you
were
chasing
me
Guess
this
is
how
it
has
to
be
now
that
we
do
not
talk
