Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh
Oh,
oh
Stand
there
like
a
ghost,
shakin'
from
the
rain,
rain
She'll
open
up
the
door
and
say,
"Are
you
insane-ane?"
Say,
"It's
been
a
long
six
months"
And
you
were
too
afraid
to
tell
her
what
you
want,
want
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl
And
then
you
say
"I
want
you
for
worse
or
for
better
I
would
wait
forever
and
ever
Broke
your
heart,
I
will
put
it
back
together
I
would
wait
forever
and
ever"
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl,
girl,
oh
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl,
girl
Remind
her
how
it
used
to
be,
be,
yeah,
yeah
Of
pictures
in
frames,
of
kisses
on
cheeks,
cheeks
Tell
her
how
you
must
have
lost
your
mind,
ooh
When
you
left
her
all
alone
and
never
told
her
why,
why
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
lost
the
girl
And
now
you
say
"I
want
you
for
worse
or
for
better
I
would
wait
forever
and
ever
(Ever
and
ever)
Broke
your
heart,
I
will
put
it
back
together
(Put
it
back
together)
I
would
wait
forever
and
ever
(Ever
and
ever)"
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl,
girl,
oh
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl,
girl,
yeah,
yeah
And
you
know
That
I
do
not
want
you
to
go
Remind
me
how
it
used
to
be
Pictures
in
frames
of
kisses
on
cheeks
And
say
you
want
me,
yeah,

because
And
then
you
say
"I
want
you
for
worse
or
for
better
(Worse

for
better)

would
wait
forever
and

will
put
it
back
together
I
want
you
forever
and
ever
(I

you
forever
and
ever)"
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how
you
get
the
girl,
girl
('Cause
it
is
how
it
works)
And
that
is
how
it
works
That's
how

get
the
girl,
girl
(Get
