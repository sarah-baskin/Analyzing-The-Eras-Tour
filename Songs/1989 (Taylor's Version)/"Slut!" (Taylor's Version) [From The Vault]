Flamingo
pink,
Sunrise
Boulevard
Clink,
clink,
being
this
young
is
art
Aquamarine,
moonlit
swimmin'
pool
What
if
all
I
need
is
you?
Got
love-struck,
went
straight
to
my
head
Got
lovesick
all
over
my
bed
Love
to
think
you
will
never
forget
Handprints
in
wet
cement
Adorned
with
smoke
on
my
clothes
Lovelorn
and
nobody
knows
Love
thorns
all
over
this
rose
I
will
pay
the
price,
you
will
not
But
if
I
am
all
dressed
up
They
might
as
well
be
lookin'
at
us
And
if
they
call
me
a
slut
You
know
it
might
be
worth
it
for
once
And
if
I
am
going
to
be
drunk
I
might
as
well
be
drunk
in
love
Send
the
code,
he
is
waitin'
there
The
sticks
and
stones
they
throw
froze
mid-air
Everyone
wants
him,
that
was
my
crime
The
wrong
place
at
the
right
time
And
I
break
down,
then
he
is
pullin'
me
in
In
a
world
of
boys,
he
is
a
gentleman
Got
love-struck,
went
straight
to
my
head
(Straight
to
my
head)
Got
lovesick
all
over
my
bed
(Over
my
bed)
Love
to
think
you
will
never
forget
We'll
pay
the
price,
I
guess
But
if
I
am
all
dressed
up
(If
I
am
all
dressed
up)
They
might
as
well
be
lookin'
at
us
(Lookin'
at
us)
And
if
they
call
me
a
slut
(If
they
call
me
a
slut)
You
know
it
might
be
worth
it
for
once
(Worth
it
for
once)
And
if
I
am
going
to
be
drunk
I
might
as
well
be
drunk
in
love
Half
asleep
Takin'
your
time
in
the
tangerine
Neon
light,
this
is
luxury
You're
not
sayin'
you
are
in
love
with
me
But
you
are
goin'
to
Half
awake
Takin'
your
chance,
it
is
a
big
mistake
I
said,
"It
might
blow
up
in
your
pretty
face"
I
am
not
sayin',
"Do
it
anyway"
(Do
it
anyway)
But
you
are
going
to
(Up)
And
if
they
call
me
a
(Slut)
You
know
it
might
be
worth
it
for
once
And
if
I
am
going
to
be
(Drunk)
I
might
as
well
be
drunk
in
love
