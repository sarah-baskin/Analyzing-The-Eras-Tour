Hit
the
ground,
hit
the
ground,
hit
the
ground,
oh,
oh
Only
sound,
only
sound
that
you
hear
is,
"No"
You
never
saw
it
comin',
slipped
when
you
started
runnin'
And
now
you
have
come
undone
and
I,
I,
I,
I
Seen
you
fall,
seen
you
crawl
on
your
knees,
eh,
ayy
Seen
you
lost
in
a
crowd,
seen
your
colors
fade
Wish
I
could
make
it
better,
someday,
you
will
not
remember
This
pain
you
thought
would
last
forever
and
ever
and
There
you
will
stand,
ten
feet
tall
I
will
say,
"I
knew
it
all
along"
Your
eyes,
wider
than
distance
This
life
is
sweeter
than
fiction
Just
a
shot,
just
a
shot
in
the
dark,
oh,
oh
All
you
got,
all
you
got
are
your
shattered
hopes
They
never
saw
it
comin',
you
hit
the
ground
runnin'
And
now
you
are
on
to
somethin',
I,
I,
I
say
"What
a
sight,
what
a
sight"
when
the
light
came
on
Proved
me
right,
proved
me
right
when
you
proved
them
wrong
And,
in
this
perfect
weather,
it
is
like
we
do
not
remember
The
rain
we
thought
would
last
forever
and
ever
There
you
will
stand,
ten
feet
tall
I
will
say,
"I
knew
it
all
along"
Your
eyes,
wider
than
distance
This
life
is
sweeter
than
fiction
(Woah)
There
you
will
stand,
next
to
me
(Next
to
me)
All
at
once,
the
rest
is
history
Your
eyes,
wider
than
distance
This
life
is
sweeter
than
fiction
(Woah;
Sweeter
than
fiction)
I
will
be
one
of
the
many
sayin'
"Look
at
you
now,
look
at
you
now
and
now"
I
will
be
one
of
the
many
saying
"You've
made
us
proud,
you
have
made
us
proud,
proud"
I
will
be
one
of
the
many
sayin'
"Look
at
you
now,
look
at
you
now
and
now"
I
will
be
one
of
the
many
sayin'
"You've
made
us
proud,
you
have
made
us
proud,
proud"
And
when
they
call
your
name
And
they
put
your
picture
in
a
frame
You
know
that
I
will
be
there
time
and
again
'Cause
I
loved
you
when,
when
you
Hit
the
ground,
hit
the
ground,
hit
the
ground,
oh,
oh
Only
sound,
only
sound
that
you
heard
was,
"No"
Now,
in
this
perfect
weather,
it
is
like
we
do
not
remember
The
rain
we
thought
would
last
forever
and
ever
(Forever)
There
you
will
stand,
ten
feet
tall
(Ten
feet
tall)
I
will
say,
"I
knew
it
all
along"
(Along)
Your
eyes,
wider
than
distance
(I
knew
it
all
along)
This
life
is
sweeter
than
fiction
(Sweeter
than
fiction)
There
you
will
stand,
next
to
me
(Next
to
me)
All
at
once,
the
rest
is
history
(Ooh)
Your
eyes,
wider
than
distance
(I
knew
it
all
along)
This
life
is
sweeter
than
fiction
(It's
sweeter
than
fiction)
It's
sweeter
than
fiction
It's
sweeter,
yeah
It's
sweeter,
it
is
sweeter
It's
sweeter
than
fiction
