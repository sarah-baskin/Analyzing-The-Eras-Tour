blood

love

have
done
'Cause,

bad
blood,

problems
And

think
we
can
solve
them
You
made
a
really
deep
cut
And,
baby,
now
we
got
bad
blood,
hey
Did
you
have
to
do
this?
I
was
thinking
that
you
could
be
trusted
Did
you
have
to
ruin
What
was
shiny?
Now
it
is
all
rusted
Did
you
have
to
hit
me
Where
I
am
weak?
Baby,
I
could
not
breathe
And
rub
it
in
so
deep
Salt
in
the
wound
like
you
are
laughin'
right
at
me
Oh,
it
is
so
sad
to
Think
about
the
good
times
You
and
I
'Cause,

deep
cut
And,
baby,
now
we
got
bad
blood,
hey
Did
you
think
we
would
be
fine?
Still
got
scars
on
my
back
from
your
knife
So
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
past
These
kind
of
wounds,
they
last
and
they
last
Now,
did
you
think
it
all
through?
All
these
things
will
catch
up
to
you
And
time
can
heal,
but
this
will
not
So
if
you
are
comin'
my
way,
just
