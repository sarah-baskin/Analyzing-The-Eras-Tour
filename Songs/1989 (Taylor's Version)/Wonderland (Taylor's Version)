lights
and
we
took
a
wrong
turn
and
we
fell
down
a
rabbit
hole
you
held
on
tight
to
me
'cause
nothing
's
as
it
seems
and
spinning
out
of
control
did
n't
they
tell
us
,
``
do
n't
rush
into
things
''
?
did
n't
you
flash
your
green
eyes
at
me
?
have
n't
you
heard
what
becomes
of
curious
minds
?
ooh
,
did
n't
it
all
seem
new
and
excitin
'
?
i
felt
your
arms
twistin
'
around
me
i
should
have
slept
with
one
eye
open
at
night
we
found
wonderland
,
you
and
i
got
lost
in
it
and
we
pretended
it
could
last
forever

,
we
went
on
our
way
too
in
love
to
think
straight
all
alone
or
so
it
seemed
but
there
were
strangers
watchin
'
and
whispers
turned
to
talkin
'
and
talking
turned
to
screams
,
oh
did
n't
they
tell
us
,
``
do
n't
rush
into
things
''
?
did
n't
you
flash
your
green
eyes
at
me
?

n't
you
calm
my
fears
with
a
cheshire
cat
smile
?

it
all
seem
new
and
excitin
