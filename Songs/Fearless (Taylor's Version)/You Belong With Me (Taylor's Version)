on
the
phone
with
your

's
upset

's
goin
'
off
about
something
that

your
humor
like

in
my
room
,
it
's
a
typical
tuesday
night
i
'm
listening
to
the
kind
of
music
she
does
n't
like
and
she
'll
never
know
your
story
like
i
do
'cause
she
wears
short
skirts
,
i
wear
t-shirts
she
's
cheer
captain
and
i
'm
on
the
bleachers
dreaming
'bout
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
that
what
you
're
lookin
'
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
if

be
laughin
'
on

park
bench
,
thinking
to
myself
``

?
''
and
you
've
got
a
smile
that
could
light
up
this
whole
town

a
while
since

you
down
