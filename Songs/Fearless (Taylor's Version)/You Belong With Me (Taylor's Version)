You're
on
the
phone
with
your
girlfriend,
she
is
upset
She's
goin'
off
about
something
that
you
said
'Cause
she
does
not
get
your
humor
like
I
do
I
am
in
my
room,
it
is
a
typical
Tuesday
night
I
am
listening
to
the
kind
of
music
she
does
not
like
And
she
will
never
know
your
story
like
I
do
'Cause
she
wears
short
skirts,
I
wear
T-shirts
She's
Cheer
Captain
and
I
am
on
the
bleachers
Dreaming
'bout
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
That
what
you
are
lookin'
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
If
you
could
see
that
I
am
the
one
who
understands
you
Been
here
all
along,
so
why
cannot
you
see?
You
belong
with
me,
you
belong
with
me
Walking
the
streets
with
you
and
your
worn-out
jeans
I
cannot
help
thinking
this
is
how
it
ought
to
be
Laughin'
on
a
park
bench,
thinking
to
myself
"Hey,
is
not
this
easy?"
And
you
have
got
a
smile
that
could
light
up
this
whole
town
I
have
not
seen
it
in
a
while
since
she
brought
you
down
You
say
you
are
fine,
I
know
you
better
than
that
Hey,
what
you
doin'
with
a
girl
like
that?
She
wears
high
heels,
I
wear
sneakers
She's
Cheer
Captain
and
I
am
on
the
bleachers
Dreaming
about
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
That
what
you
are
lookin'
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
If
you
could
see
that
I
am
the
one
who
understands
you
Been
here
all
along,
so
why
cannot
you
see?
You
belong
with
me
Standin'
by
and
waitin'
at
your
back
door
All
this
time,
how
could
you
not
know,
baby?
You
belong
with
me,
you
belong
with
me
Oh,
I
remember
you
Driving
to
my
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
I
am
the
one
who
makes
you
laugh
when
you
know
you
are
'bout
to
cry
I
know
your
favorite
songs
and
you
tell
me
'bout
your
dreams
Think
I
know
where
you
belong,
think
I
know
it
is
with
me
Can't
you
see
that
I
am
the
one
who
understands
you?
Been
here
all
along,
so
why
cannot
you
see?
(Ah)
You
belong
with
me
Standin'
by
and
waitin'
at
your
back
door
All
this
time,
how
could
you
not
know,
baby?
You
belong
with
me,
you
belong
with
me
You
belong
with
me
Have
you
ever
thought,
just
maybe
you
belong
with
me?
You
belong
with
me
