We
used
to
walk
along
the
streets
When
the
porch
lights
were
shinin'
bright
Before
I
had
somewhere
to
be
Back
when
we
had
all
night
And
we
were
happy
I
do
recall
a
good
while
back
We
snuck
into
the
circus
You
threw
your
arms
around
my
neck
Back
when
I
deserved
it
And
we
were
happy
[Chorus]
When
it
was
good,
baby,
it
was
good,
baby
We
showed
'em
all
up
No
one
could
touch
the
way
we
Laughed
in
the
dark,
talkin'
'bout
your
daddy's
farm
We
were
gonna
buy
someday
And
we
were
happy
[Verse
2]
We
used
to
watch
the
Sun
go
down
On
the
boats
in
the
water
That's
sorta
how
I
feel
right
now
And
goodbye's
so
much
harder
'Cause
we
were
happy
[Chorus]
When
it
was
good,
baby,
it
was
good,
baby
We
showed
'em
all
up
No
one
could
touch
the
way
we
Laughed
in
the
dark,
talkin'
'bout
your
daddy's
farm
We
were
gonna
buy
someday
And
we
were
happy
[Post-Chorus]
We
were
happy
[Bridge]
Oh,
I
hate
those
voices
Tellin'
me
I'm
not
in
love
anymore
But
they
don't
give
me
choices
And
that's
what
these
tears
are
for
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause
we
were
happy
We
were
happy
[Chorus]
When
it
was
good,
baby,
it
was
good,
baby
We
showed
'em
all
up
No
one
could
touch
the
way
we
Laughed
in
the
dark,
talkin'
'bout
your
daddy's
farm
And
you
were
gonna
marry
me
And
we
were
happy
[Outro]
We
were
happy
Oh,
we
were
happy
