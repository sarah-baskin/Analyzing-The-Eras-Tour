we
used
to
walk
along
the
streets
when
the
porch
lights
were
shinin
'
bright
before
i
had
somewhere
to
be
back
when
we
had
all
night
and
we
were
happy
i
do
recall
a
good
while
back
we
snuck
into
the
circus
you
threw
your
arms
around
my
neck
back
when
i
deserved
it
and
we
were
happy
when
it
was
good
,
baby
,
it
was
good
,
baby
we
showed
'em
all
up
no
one
could
touch
the
way
we
laughed
in
the
dark
,
talkin
'
'bout
your
daddy
's
farm
we
were
gon
na
buy
someday
and
we
were
happy
we
used
to
watch
the
sun
go
down
on
the
boats
in
the
water
that
's
sorta
how
i
feel
right
now
and
goodbye
's
so
much
harder
'cause
we
were
happy
when
it
was
good
,
baby
,
it
was
good
,
baby
we
showed
'em
all
