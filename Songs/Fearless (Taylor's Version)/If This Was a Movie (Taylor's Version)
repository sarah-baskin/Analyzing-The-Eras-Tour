Last
night,
I
heard
my
own
heart
beatin'
Sounded
like
footsteps
on
my
stairs
Six
months
gone
and
I
am
still
reachin'
Even
though
I
know
you
are
not
there
I
was
playin'
back
a
thousand
memories,
baby
Thinkin'
'bout
everything
we
have
been
through
Maybe
I
have
been
going
back
too
much
lately
When
time
stood
still
and
I
had
you
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
would,
you
would
if
this
was
a
movie
Stand
in
the
rain
outside
'til
I
came
out
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
could,
you
could
if
you
just
said
you
are
sorry
I
know
that
we
could
work
it
out
somehow
But
if
this
was
a
movie,
you
would
be
here
by
now
I
know
people
change
and
these
things
happen
But
I
remember
how
it
was
back
then
Wrapped
up
in
your
arms
and
our
friends
are
laughin'
'Cause
nothing
like
this
ever
happened
to
them
Now
I
am
pacing
down
the
hall,
chasing
down
your
street
Flashback
to
the
night
when
you
said
to
me
Nothing's
going
to
change,
not
for
me
and
you
Back
before
I
knew
how
much
I
had
to
lose
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
would,
you
would
if
this
was
a
movie
Stand
in
the
rain
outside
'til
I
came
out
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
could,
you
could
if
you
just
said
you
are
sorry
I
know
that
we
could
work
it
out
somehow
But
if
this
was
a
movie,
you
would
be
here
by
now
If
you
are
out
there,
if
you
are
somewhere,
if
you
are
moving
on
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
every
day
since
you
have
been
gone
I
just
want
it
back
the
way
it
was
before
And
I
just
want
to
see
you
back
at
my
front
door
And
I
say,
"Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
would
before
you
said
it
is
not
that
easy
Before
the
fight,
before
I
locked
you
out"
But
I
take
it
all
back
now
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
would,
you
would
if
this
was
a
movie
Stand
in
the
rain
outside
'til
I
came
out
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back
to
me
like
You
could,
you
could
if
you
just
said
you
are
sorry
I
know
that
we
could
work
it
out
somehow
But
if
this
was
a
movie,
you
would
be
here
by
now
You'd
be
here
by
now
It's
not
the
kind
of
ending
you
want
to
see
now
Baby,
what
about
the
ending?
Oh,
I
thought
that
you
would
be
here
by
now
Oh,
oh
Thought
you
would
be
here
by
now
