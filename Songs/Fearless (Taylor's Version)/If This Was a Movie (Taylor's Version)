last
night
,
i
heard
my
own
heart
beatin
'
sounded
like
footsteps
on
my
stairs
six
months
gone
and
i
'm
still
reachin
'
even
though
i
know
you
're
not
there
i
was
playin
'
back
a
thousand
memories
,
baby
thinkin
'
'bout
everything
we
've
been
through
maybe
i
've
been
going
back
too
much
lately
when
time
stood
still
and
i
had
you
come
back
,
come
back
,
come
back
to
me
like
you
would
,
you
would
if
this
was
a
movie
stand
in
the
rain
outside
'til
i
came
out
come
back
,
come
back
,
come
back
to
me
like
you
could
,
you
could
if
you
just
said
you
're
sorry
i
know
that
we
could
work
it
out
somehow
but
if
this
was
a
movie
,
you
'd
be
here
by
now
i
know
people
change
and
these
things
happen
but
i
remember
how
it
was
back
then
wrapped
up
in
your
arms
and
our
friends
are
laughin
'
'cause
nothing
like
this
ever
happened
to
them
now
i
'm
pacing
down
the
hall
,
chasing
down
your
street
flashback
to
the
night
when
you
said
to
me
nothing
's
gon
na
change
,
not
for
me
and
you
back
before
i
knew
how
much
i
had
to
lose
come
back
,
come
back
,
come
back
to
me
like
you
would
,
you
would
if
this
was
a
movie
stand
in
the
rain
outside
'til
i
came
out
come
back
,
come
back
,
come
back
to
me
like
you
could
,
you
could
if
you
just
said
you
're
sorry
i
know
that
we
could
work
it
out
somehow
but
if
this
was
a
movie
,
you
'd
be
here
by
now
if
you
're
out
there
,
if
you
're
somewhere
,
if
you
're
moving
on
i
've
been
waiting
for
you
every
day
since
you
've
been
gone
i
just
want
it
back
the
way
it
was
before
and
i
just
wan
na
see
you
back
at
my
front
door
and
i
say
,
``

back
,

back
,

back
to
me
like
you
would
before
you
said
it
's
not
that
easy
before
the
fight
,
before
i
locked
you
out
''
but
i
take
it
all
back
now

,

back
,
come
back
to
me
like
