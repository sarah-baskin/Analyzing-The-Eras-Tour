You
take
a
deep
breath
and
you
walk
through
the
doors
It's
the
mornin'
of
your
very
first
day
You
say
hi
to
your
friends
you
are
not
seen
in
a
while
Try
and
stay
out
of
everybody's
way
It's
your
freshman
year
and
you
are
going
to
be
here
For
the
next
four
years
in
this
town
Hopin'
one
of
those
senior
boys
will
wink
at
you
and
say
"You
know,
I
have
not
seen
you
around
before"
'Cause
when
you
are
fifteen
and
somebody
tells
you
they
love
you
You're
going
to
believe
them
And
when
you
are
fifteen,
feelin'
like
there
is
nothin'
to
figure
out
Well,
count
to
ten,
take
it
in
This
is
life
before
you
know
who
you
are
going
to
be
At
fifteen
You
sit
in
class
next
to
a
redhead
named
Abigail
And
soon
enough,
you
are
best
friends
Laughin'
at
the
other
girls
who
think
they
are
so
cool
We'll
be
outta
here
as
soon
as
we
can
And
then
you
are
on
your
very
first
date
and
he
is
got
a
car
And
you
are
feelin'
like
flyin'
And
your
mama's
waitin'
up
and
you
are
thinkin'
he
is
the
one
And
you
are
dancin'
'round
your
room
when
the
night
ends
When
the
night
ends
'Cause
when
you
are
fifteen
and
somebody
tells
you
they
love
you
You're
going
to
believe
them
And
when
you
are
fifteen
and
your
first
kiss
Makes
your
head
spin
around,
well
In
your
life
you
will
do
things
greater
than
Datin'
the
boy
on
the
football
team
I
did
not
know
it
at
fifteen
When
all
you
wanted
was
to
be
wanted
Wish
you
could
go
back
And
tell
yourself
what
you
know
now
Back
then,
I
swore
I
was
going
to
marry
him
someday
But
I
realized
some
bigger
dreams
of
mine
And
Abigail
gave
everything
she
had
To
a
boy
who
changed
his
mind
And
we
both
cried
'Cause
when
you
are
fifteen
and
somebody
tells
you
they
love
you
You're
going
to
believe
them
And
when
you
are
fifteen,
do
not
forget
to
look
before
you
fall
But
I
have
found
time
can
heal
most
anything
And
you
just
might
find
who
you
are
supposed
to
be
I
did
not
know
who
I
was
supposed
to
be
At
fifteen
La-la-la,
la-la-la,
la-la-la-la
La-la-la,
la-la-la,
la-la-la-la
La-la-la,
la-la-la
Your
very
first
day
Take
a
deep
breath,
girl
Take
a
deep
breath
as
you
walk
through
the
doors
