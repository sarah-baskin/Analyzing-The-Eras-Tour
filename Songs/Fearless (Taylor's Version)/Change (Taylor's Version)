Well,
it
is
a
sad
picture,
the
final
blow
hits
ya
Somebody
else
gets
what
you
wanted
again
and
You
know
it
is
all
the
same,
another
time
and
place
Repeatin'
history
and
you
are
gettin'
sick
of
it
But
I
believe
in
whatever
you
do
And
I
will
do
anything
to
see
it
through
Because
these
things
will
change,
can
you
feel
it
now?
These
walls
that
they
put
up
to
hold
us
back
will
fall
down
This
revolution,
the
time
will
come
for
us
to
finally
win
And
we
will
sing
hallelujah,
we
will
sing
hallelujah
Oh,
oh
So
we
have
been
outnumbered,
raided
and,
now,
cornered
It's
hard
to
fight
when
the
fight
are
not
fair
We're
getting
stronger
now,
find
things
they
never
found
They
might
be
bigger
but
we
are
faster
and
never
scared
You
can
walk
away,
say,
"We
do
not
need
this"
But
there
is
somethin'
in
your
eyes,
says,
"We
can
beat
this"
'Cause
these
things
will
change,
can
you
feel
it
now?
These
walls
that
they
put
up
to
hold
us
back
will
fall
down
This
revolution,
the
time
will
come
for
us
to
finally
win
And
we
will
sing
hallelujah,
we
will
sing
hallelujah
Oh,
oh-woah
Tonight,
we
will
stand
and
get
off
our
knees
Fight
for
what
we
have
worked
for
all
these
years
And
the
battle
was
long,
it
is
the
fight
of
our
lives
But
we
will
stand
up
champions
tonight
It
was
the
night
things
changed,
can
you
see
it
now?
When
the
walls
that
they
put
up
to
hold
us
back
fell
down
It's
a
revolution,
throw
your
hands
up
because
we
never
gave
in
And
we
will
sing
hallelujah,
we
sang
hallelujah,
oh
Hallelujah
