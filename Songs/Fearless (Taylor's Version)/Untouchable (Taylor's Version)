Untouchable
like
a
distant
diamond
sky
I
am
reachin'
out
and
I
just
cannot
tell
you
why
I
am
caught
up
in
you,
I
am
caught
up
in
you
Untouchable,
burning
brighter
than
the
sun
And
when
you
are
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I
am
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
got
to
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we
will
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
little
taste
of
Heaven
Oh,
oh
It's
half
full
and
I
will
not
wait
here
all
day
I
know
you
are
sayin'
that
you
would
be
here
anyway
But
you
are
untouchable,
burnin'
brighter
than
the
sun
And
now
that
you
are
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I
am
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
got
to
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we
will
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
oh
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
wakin'
from
this
dream
I
want
to
feel
you
by
my
side,
standin'
next
to
me
You
got
to
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we
will
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
little
taste
of
Heaven
I
am
caught
up
in
you
Oh,
oh
But
you
are
untouchable,
burnin'
brighter
than
the
sun
Now
that
you
are
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I
am
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
got
to
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we
will
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
oh
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I
am
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
got
to
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we
will
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on
In
the

of
the
night,
wakin'
from
this
dream
I
want
to
feel
you

Come
on,
come
on,
little

Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
And
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I
am
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your

You

Come

come
on
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
It's
like
a

little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
Spellin'
out
your
name,
oh
