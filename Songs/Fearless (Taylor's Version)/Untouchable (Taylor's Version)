Untouchable
like
a
distant
diamond
sky
I'm
reachin'
out
and
I
just
can't
tell
you
why
I'm
caught
up
in
you,
I'm
caught
up
in
you
[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable,
burning
brighter
than
the
sun
And
when
you're
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
[Chorus]
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I'm
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
little
taste
of
Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh,
oh
[Verse
2]
It's
half
full
and
I
won't
wait
here
all
day
I
know
you're
sayin'
that
you'd
be
here
anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
But
you're
untouchable,
burnin'
brighter
than
the
sun
And
now
that
you're
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
[Chorus]
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I'm
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
oh
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
wakin'
from
this
dream
I
wanna
feel
you
by
my
side,
standin'
next
to
me
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
little
taste
of
Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
I'm
caught
up
in
you
Oh,
oh
[Pre-Chorus]
But
you're
untouchable,
burnin'
brighter
than
the
sun
Now
that
you're
close,
I
feel
like
comin'
undone
[Chorus]
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I'm
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
oh
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I'm
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on
In
the
middle
of
the
night,
wakin'
from
this
dream
I
wanna
feel
you
by
my
side,
standin'
next
to
me
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
say
that
we'll
be
together
Come
on,
come
on,
little
taste
of
Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
[Chorus]
And
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
I'm
in
this
dream
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
You
gotta
come
on,
come
on,
oh
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on,
come
on
[Post-Chorus]
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
[Outro]
It's
like
a
million
little
stars
spellin'
out
your
name
Spellin'
out
your
name,
oh
