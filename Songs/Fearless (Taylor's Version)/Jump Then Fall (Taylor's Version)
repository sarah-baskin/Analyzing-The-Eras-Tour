I
like
the
way
you
sound
in
the
mornin'
We're
on
the
phone
and
without
a
warnin'
I
realize
your
laugh
is
the
best
sound
I
have
ever
heard
I
like
the
way
I
cannot
keep
my
focus
I
watch
you
talk,
you
did
not
notice
I
hear
the
words,
but
all
I
can
think
is
"We
should
be
together"
Every
time
you
smile,
I
smile
And
every
time
you
shine,
I
will
shine
for
you
Woah-oh,
I
am
feelin'
you,
baby
Don't
be
afraid
to
jump,
then
fall
Jump,
then
fall
into
me
Baby,
I
am
never
going
to
leave
you
Say
that
you
want
to
be
with
me
too
'Cause
I'ma
stay
through
it
all
So,
jump,
then
fall
Huh,
well,
I
like
the
way
your
hair
falls
in
your
face
You
got
the
keys
to
me,
I
love
each
freckle
on
your
face,
oh
I
have
never
been
so
wrapped
up,
honey
I
like
the
way
you
are
everything
I
ever
wanted
I
had
time
to
think
it
oh-over
And
all
I
can
say
is,
"Come
closer"
Take
a
deep
breath
and
jump,
then
fall
into
me
'Cause
every
time
you
smile,
I
smile
And
every
time
you
shine,
I
will
shine
for
you
Woah-oh,
I
am
feelin'
you,
baby
Don't
be
afraid
to
jump,
then
fall
Jump,
then
fall
into
me
Baby,
I
am
never
going
to
leave
you
Say
that
you
want
to
be
with
me
too
'Cause
I'ma
stay
through
it
all
So,
jump,
then
fall
The
bottom's
going
to
drop
out
from
under
our
feet
I
will
catch
you,
I
will
catch
you
When
people
say
things
that
bring
you
to
your
knees
I
will
catch
you
The
time
is
going
to
come
when
you
are
so
mad
you
could
cry
But
I
will
hold
you
through
the
night
until
you
smile
Woah-oh,
I
need
you,
baby
Don't
be
afraid,
please,
jump,
then
fall
Jump,
then
fall
into
me
Baby,
I
am
never
going
to
leave
you
Say
that
you
want
to
be
with
me
too
'Cause
I'ma
stay
through
it
all
So,
jump,
then
fall
Jump,
then
fall,
baby
Jump,
then
fall
into
me,
into
me
Every
time
you
smile,
I
smile
And
every
time
you
shine,
I
will
shine
And
every
time
you
are
here
Baby,
I
will
show
you,
I
will
show
you
You
can
jump,
then
fall,
jump,
then
fall
Jump,
then
fall
into
me,
into
me,
yeah
