We
were
both
young
when
I
first
saw
you
I
close
my
eyes
and
the
flashback
starts
I
am
standing
there
On
a
balcony
in
summer
air
See
the
lights,
see
the
party,
the
ball
gowns
See
you
make
your
way
through
the
crowd
And
say,
"Hello"
Little
did
I
know
That
you
were
Romeo,
you
were
throwing
pebbles
And
my
daddy
said,
"Stay
away
from
Juliet"
And
I
was
crying
on
the
staircase
Begging
you,
"Please
do
not
go,"
and
I
said
Romeo,
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
I
will
be
waiting,
all
there
is
left
to
do
is
run
You'll
be
the
prince
and
I
will
be
the
princess
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say,
"Yes"
So
I
sneak
out
to
the
garden
to
see
you
We
keep
quiet
because
we
are
dead
if
they
knew
So
close
your
eyes
Escape
this
town
for
a
little
while,
oh,
oh
'Cause
you
were
Romeo,
I
was
a
scarlet
letter
And
my
daddy
said,
"Stay
away
from
Juliet"
But
you
were
everything
to
me
I
was
begging
you,
"Please
do
not
go,"
and
I
said
Romeo,
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
I
will
be
waiting,
all
there
is
left
to
do
is
run
You'll
be
the
prince
and
I
will
be
the
princess
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say,
"Yes"
Romeo,
save
me,
they
are
trying
to
tell
me
how
to
feel
This
love
is
difficult,
but
it
is
real
Don't
be
afraid,
we
will
make
it
out
of
this
mess
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say,
"Yes"
Oh,
oh
But
I
got
tired
of
waiting
Wondering
if
you
were
ever
coming
around
My
faith
in
you
was
fading
When
I
met
you
on
the
outskirts
of
town
And
I
said,
"Romeo,
save
me,
I
have
been
feeling
so
alone
I
keep
waiting
for
you,
but
you
never
come
Is
this
in
my
head?
I
do
not
know
what
to
think"
He
knelt
to
the
ground
and
pulled
out
a
ring,
and
said
"Marry
me,
Juliet,
you
will
never
have
to
be
alone
I
love
you
and
that
is
all
I
really
know
I
talked
to
your
dad,
go
pick
out
a
white
dress
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say,
'Yes'"
Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh
'Cause
we
were
both
young
when
I
first
saw
you
