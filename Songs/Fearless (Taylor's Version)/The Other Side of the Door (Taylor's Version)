in
the
heat
of
the
fight
,
i
walked
away
ignorin
'
words
that
you
were
sayin
'
,
tryna
make
me
stay
i
said
,
``
this
time
i
've
had
enough
''
and
you
've
called
a
hundred
times
but
i
'm
not
pickin
'
up
'cause
i
'm
so
mad
,
i
might
tell
you
that
it
's
over
but
if
you
look
a
little
closer
i
said
,
``

,
''
but
all
i
really
want
is
you
to
stand
outside
my
window
,
throwin
'
pebbles
screamin
'
,
``
i
'm
in
love
with
you
''
wait
there
in
the
pourin
'
rain
,
comin
'
back
for
more
and
do
n't
you
leave
'cause
i
know
all
i
need
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
well
,
me
and
my
stupid
pride
are
sittin
'
here
alone
goin
'
through
the
photographs
,
starin
'
at
the
phone
i
keep
goin
'
back
over
things
we
both
said
and
i
remember
the
slammin
'
door
and
all
the
things
that
i
misread
oh
,
babe
,
if
you
know
everything
tell
me
why
you
could
n't
see
when
i
left
,
i
wanted
you
to
chase
after
me
,

i
said
,
``
leave
,
''
but
all
i
really
want
is
you
to
stand
outside
my
window
throwin
'
pebbles
screamin
'
,
``
i
'm
in
love
with
you
''
wait
there
in
the
pourin
'
rain
,
comin
'
back
for
more
and
do
n't
you
leave
'cause
i
know
all
i

'll
scream
out
the
window
``

ca
n't
even
look
at
you
''
i
do
n't
need
you
,
but
i
do
,
i
do
,
i
do
i
say
,
``

's
nothin
'
you
can
say
to
make
this
right
again
,
i
mean
it
,
i
mean
it
''
but
what
i
mean
is
i
said
,
``

,
all
i
want
is
you
to
stand

the
other
side
of
the
door
with
your
face
and
the
beautiful
eyes
and
the
conversation
with
the
little
white
lies
and
the
faded
picture
of
a
beautiful
night
you
carried
me
from
your
car
up
the
stairs
and
i
broke
down
cryin
'
,
was
she
worth
this
mess
?
after
everything
and
that
little
black
dress
after
everything
,
i
must
confess
i
need
you
