Once
the
last
drop
of
rain
has
dried
off
the
pavement
Shouldn't
I
find
a
stain?
But
I
never
do
The
way
the
tires
turn
stones
on
old
county
roads
They
leave
them
muddy
underneath,
reminds
me
of
you
You
find
graffiti
on
the
walls
of
old
bathroom
stalls,
you
know
You
can
scratch
it
right
off,
it
is
how
it
used
to
be
But
like
the
dollar
in
your
pocket,
it
is
been
spent
and
traded
in
You
cannot
change
where
it
is
been,
reminds
me
of
me
I
lived
and
I
learned
Had
you,
got
burned
Held
out
and
held
on
God
knows,
too
long,
and
wasted
time
Lost
tears,
swore
that
I
would
get
out
of
here
But
no
amount
of
freedom
gets
you
clean
I
have
still
got
you
all
over
me
The
best
and
worst
day
of
June
Was
the
one
that
I
met
you
With
your
hands
in
your
pockets
And
your
"Don't
you
wish
you
had
me?"
grin
Well
I
did,
so
I
smiled,
and
I
melted
like
a
child
Now,
every
breath
of
air
I
breathe
reminds
me
of
then
And
I
lived
and
I
learned
Had
you,
got
burned
Held
out
and
held
on
God
knows,
too
long,
and
wasted
time
Lost
tears,
swore
that
I
would
get
out
of
here
But
no
amount
of
freedom
gets
you
clean
I
have
still
got
you
all
over
me
I
lived
and
I
learned
And
found
out
what
it
was
to
turn
around
And
see
that
we
Were
never
really
meant
to
be
So
I
lied,
and
I
cried
And
I
watched
a
part
of
myself
die
'Cause
no
amount
of
freedom
gets
you
clean
I
have
still
got
you
all
over
me
I
have
still
got
you
all
over
me
Still
got
you
all
over
me
