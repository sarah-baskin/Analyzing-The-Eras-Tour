once
the
last
drop
of
rain
has
dried
off
the
pavement
should
n't
i
find
a
stain
?
but
i
never
do
the
way
the
tires
turn
stones
on
old
county
roads
they
leave
'em
muddy
underneath
,
reminds
me
of
you
you
find
graffiti
on
the
walls
of
old
bathroom
stalls
,
you
know
you
can
scratch
it
right
off
,
it
's
how
it
used
to
be
but
like
the
dollar
in
your
pocket
,
it
's
been
spent
and
traded
in
you
ca
n't
change
where
it
's
been
,
reminds
me
of
me
taylor
swift
&
maren
i
lived
and
i
learned
had
you
,
got
burned
held
out
and
held
on
god
knows
,
too
long
,
and
wasted
time
lost
tears
,
swore
that
i
'd
get
out
of
here
but
no
amount
of
freedom
gets
you
clean
i
've
still
got
you
all
over
me

the
best
and
worst
day
of
june
was
the
one
that
i
met
you
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
and
your
``
do
n't
you
wish
you
had
me
?
''
grin
well
i
did
,
so
i
smiled
,
and
i
melted
like
a
child
now
,
every
breath
of
air
i
breathe
reminds
me
of
then
taylor
swift
&
maren
and
i
lived
and
i
learned
had
you
,
got
burned
held
out
and
held
on
god

,
too
long
,
and

time
lost
tears

what
it
was
to
turn
around
and
see
that
we
were
never
really
meant
to
be
so
i
lied
,
and
i
cried
and
i
watched
a
part
of
myself
die
'cause
