You
said,
"I
know"
When
I
said,
"I
need
some
time,
need
some
space
To
think
about
all
of
this"
And
you
watched
me
go
And
I
knew
my
words
were
hard
to
hear
And
harder
to
ever
take
back
[Pre-Chorus:
Taylor
Swift]
And
I
said,
"When
can
I-I-I
come
back?"
[Chorus:
Taylor
Swift]
And
you
said,
"That's
when
When
I
wake
up
in
the
morning
That's
when,
when
it's
sunny
or
stormin'
Laughin',
when
I'm
cryin'
And
that's
when
I'll
be
waitin'
at
the
front
gate
That's
when,
when
I
see
your
face
I'll
let
you
in
and,
baby,
that's
when"
[Post-Chorus:
Keith
Urban]
Mmm,
mm
[Verse
2:
Keith
Urban,
Taylor
Swift,
Keith
Urban
&
Taylor
Swift]
I
said,
"I
know"
When
you
said,
"I
did
you
wrong,
made
mistakes
And
put
you
through
all
of
this"
(Through
all
of
this)
Then
through
the
phone
Came
all
your
tears
And
I
said,
"Leave
those
all
in
our
past"
[Pre-Chorus:
Keith
Urban]
And
you
said,
"When
can
I-I-I
come
back?"
[Chorus:
Keith
Urban,
Taylor
Swift,
Keith
Urban
&
Taylor
Swift]
And
I
said,
"That's
when
When
I
wake
up
in
the
morning
That's
when,
when
it's
sunny
or
stormin'
Laughin',
when
I'm
cryin'
And
that's
when
I'll
be
waitin'
at
the
front
gate
That's
when,
when
I
see
your
face
I'll
let
you
in
and,
baby,
that's
when"
[Bridge:
Taylor
Swift]
And
you
said,
"Honestly
When
you
were
gone
Did
you
ever
think
of
me?"
[Chorus:
Taylor
Swift,
Taylor
Swift
&
Keith
Urban]
And
I
said,
"That's
when
When
I
woke
up
in
the
morning
That's
when
it
was
sunny
or
stormin'
Laughin',
when
I
was
cryin'
And
that's
when
You
were
waitin'
at
the
front
gate
That's
when,
when
I
saw
your
face
You
let
me
in,
and
baby,
that's
when"
[Outro:
Taylor
Swift,
Taylor
Swift
&
Keith
Urban]
(That's
when)
(When
I
woke
up
in
the
morning)
Yeah
(That's
when
it
was
sunny
or
stormin')
When
I'm
laughin',
when
I'm
cryin'
(That's
when
I'll
be
waitin'
at
the
front
gate)
That's
when
I
miss
you,
that's
when
I
want
you
(That's
when,
when
I
see
your
face)
That's
when
I
love
you,
that's
when
