There's
somethin'
'bout
the
way
The
street
looks
when
it
is
just
rained
There's
a
glow
off
the
pavement
You
walk
me
to
the
car
And
you
know
I
want
to
ask
you
to
dance
right
there
In
the
middle
of
the
parkin'
lot,
yeah
Oh,
yeah
We're
driving
down
the
road
I
wonder
if
you
know
I
am
trying
so
hard
not
to
get
caught
up
now
But
you
are
just
so
cool
Run
your
hands
through
your
hair
Absent-mindedly
makin'
me
want
you
And
I
do
not
know
how
it
gets
better
than
this
You
take
my
hand
and
drag
me
headfirst,
fearless
And
I
do
not
know
why,
but
with
you,
I
would
dance
In
a
storm,
in
my
best
dress,
fearless
So,
baby,
drive
slow
'til
we
run
out
of
road
In
this
one-horse
town,
I
want
to
stay
right
here
In
this
passenger
seat,
you
put
your
eyes
on
me
In
this
moment
now,
capture
it,
remember
it
'Cause
I
do
not
know
how
it
gets
better
than
this
You
take
my
hand
and
drag
me
headfirst,
fearless
And
I
do
not
know
why,
but
with
you,
I
would
dance
In
a
storm,
in
my
best
dress,
fearless
Oh-oh
Well,
you
stood
there
with
me
in
the
doorway
My
hands
shake,
I
am
not
usually
this
way
But
you
pull
me
in
and
I
am
a
little
more
brave
It's
the
first
kiss,
it
is
flawless,
really
somethin'
It's
fearless
Oh,
yeah
'Cause
I
do
not
know
how
it
gets
better
than
this
You
take
my
hand
and
drag
me
headfirst,
fearless
And
I
do
not
know
why,
but
with
you,
I
would
dance
In
a
storm,
in
my
best
dress,
fearless
'Cause
I
do
not
know
how
it
gets
better
than
this
You
take
my
hand
and
drag
me
headfirst,
fearless
And
I
do
not
know
why,
but
with
you,
I
would
dance
In
a
storm,
in
my
best
dress,
fearless
Oh-oh
Oh-oh,
yeah
