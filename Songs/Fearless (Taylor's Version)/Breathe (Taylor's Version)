I
see
your
face
in
my
mind
as
I
drive
away
'Cause
none
of
us
thought
it
was
gonna
end
that
way
People
are
people
and
sometimes
we
change
our
minds
But
it's
killin'
me
to
see
you
go
after
all
this
time
[Break:
Taylor
Swift]
Mm,
mmm
Mm,
mmm
[Verse
2:
Taylor
Swift,
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat]
The
music
starts
playin'
like
the
end
of
a
sad
movie
It's
the
kind
of
endin'
you
don't
really
wanna
see
'Cause
it's
tragedy
and
it'll
only
bring
you
down
Now
I
don't
know
what
to
be
without
you
around
[Pre-Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
And
we
know
it's
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
You're
the
only
thing
I
know
like
the
back
of
my
hand
[Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
And
I
can't
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
[Verse
3:
Taylor
Swift,
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat]
Never
wanted
this,
never
wanna
see
you
hurt
Every
little
bump
in
the
road,
I
tried
to
swerve
But
people
are
people
and
sometimes
it
doesn't
work
out
And
nothin'
we
say
is
gonna
save
us
from
the
fallout
[Pre-Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
And
we
know
it's
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
You're
the
only
thing
I
know
like
the
back
of
my
hand
[Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
And
I
can't
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
[Bridge:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
It's
2
AM,
feelin'
like
I
just
lost
a
friend
Hope
you
know
it's
not
easy,
easy
for
me
It's
2
AM,
feelin'
like
I
just
lost
a
friend
Hope
you
know
this
ain't
easy,
easy
for
me
[Pre-Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
And
we
know
it's
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
Woah
[Chorus:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
I
can't
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
[Outro:
Taylor
Swift
&
Colbie
Caillat,
Taylor
Swift]
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry
(Mmm),
I'm
sorry
(Yeah,
yeah),
I'm
sorry
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry
(Ooh),
I'm
sorry
