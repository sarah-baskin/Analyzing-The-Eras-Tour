I
see
your
face
in
my
mind
as
I
drive
away
'Cause
none
of
us
thought
it
was
going
to
end
that
way
People
are
people
and
sometimes
we
change
our
minds
But
it
is
killin'
me
to
see
you
go
after
all
this
time
Mm,
mmm
Mm,
mmm
The
music
starts
playin'
like
the
end
of
a
sad
movie
It's
the
kind
of
endin'
you
do
not
really
want
to
see
'Cause
it
is
tragedy
and
it
will
only
bring
you
down
Now
I
do
not
know
what
to
be
without
you
around
And
we
know
it
is
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
You're
the
only
thing
I
know
like
the
back
of
my
hand
And
I
cannot
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Never
wanted
this,
never
want
to
see
you
hurt
Every
little
bump
in
the
road,
I
tried
to
swerve
But
people
are
people
and
sometimes
it
does
not
work
out
And
nothin'
we
say
is
going
to
save
us
from
the
fallout
And
we
know
it
is
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
You're
the
only
thing
I
know
like
the
back
of
my
hand
And
I
cannot
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
It's
2
AM,
feelin'
like
I
just
lost
a
friend
Hope
you
know
it
is
not
easy,
easy
for
me
It's
2
AM,
feelin'
like
I
just
lost
a
friend
Hope
you
know
this
are
not
easy,
easy
for
me
And
we
know
it
is
never
simple,
never
easy
Never
a
clean
break,
no
one
here
to
save
me
Woah
I
cannot
breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
Breathe
without
you,
but
I
have
to
I
am
sorry,
I
am
sorry
(Mmm),
I
am
sorry
(Yeah,
yeah),
I
am
sorry
I
am
sorry,
I
am
sorry
(Ooh),
I
am
sorry
