Once
upon
a
time
I
believe
it
was
a
Tuesday
when
I
caught
your
eye
And
we
caught
onto
somethin'
I
hold
onto
the
night
You
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
told
me
you
loved
me
Were
you
just
kiddin'?
'Cause
it
seems
to
me
This
thing
is
breaking
down,
we
almost
never
speak
I
do
not
feel
welcome
anymore
Baby,
what
happened?
Please,
tell
me
'Cause,
one
second,
it
was
perfect
Now
you
are
halfway
out
the
door
And
I
stare
at
the
phone,
he
still
has
not
called
And
then
you
feel
so
low
you
cannot
feel
nothin'
at
all
And
you
flashback
to
when
he
said,
"Forever
and
always,"
oh
Oh,
and
it
rains
in
your
bedroom,
everythin'
is
wrong
It
rains
when
you
are
here
and
it
rains
when
you
are
gone
'Cause
I
was
there
when
you
said,
"Forever
and
always"
Was
I
out
of
line?
Did
I
say
somethin'
way
too
honest,
made
you
run
and
hide
Like
a
scared
little
boy?
I
looked
into
your
eyes
Thought
I
knew
you
for
a
minute,
now
I
am
not
so
sure
So
here
is
to
everything
coming
down
to
nothin'
Here's
to
silence
that
cuts
me
to
the
core
Where
is
this
going?
Thought
I
knew
for
a
minute,
but
I
do
not
anymore
And
I
stare
at
the
phone,
he
still
has
not
called
And
then
you
feel
so
low
you
cannot
feel
nothin'
at
all
And
you
flashback
to
when
he
said,
"Forever
and
always,"
oh
Oh,
and
it
rains
in
your
bedroom,
everythin'
is
wrong
It
rains
when
you
are
here
and
it
rains
when
you
are
gone
'Cause
I
was
there
when
you
said,
"Forever
and
always"
You
did
not
mean
it,
baby
I
do
not
think
so
Oh,
woah
Oh,
back
up,
baby,
back
up
Did
you
forget
everything?
Back
up,
baby,
back
up
Did
you
forget
everything?
'Cause
it
rains
in
your
bedroom,
everythin'
is
wrong
It
rains
when
you
are
here
and
it
rains
when
you
are
gone
'Cause
I
was
there
when
you
said,
"Forever
and
always"
Oh,
I
stare
at
the
phone,
he
still
has
not
called
And
then
you
feel
so
low
you
cannot
feel
nothin'
at
all
And
you
flashback
to
when
we
said,
"Forever
and

And
it
rains
in
your
bedroom,
everythin'
is
wrong
It
rains
when
you
are
here
and
it
rains
when
you
are
gone
'Cause
I
was
there
when
you
said,
"Forever
and
always"
You
did
not
mean
it,
baby
You
said,
"Forever
and
always,"
yeah
