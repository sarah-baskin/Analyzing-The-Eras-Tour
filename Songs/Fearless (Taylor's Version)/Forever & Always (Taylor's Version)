once
upon
a
time
i
believe
it
was
a
tuesday
when
i
caught
your
eye
and
we
caught
onto
somethin
'
i
hold
onto
the
night
you
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
told
me
you
loved
me
were
you
just
kiddin
'
?
'cause
it
seems
to
me
this
thing
is
breaking
down
,
we
almost
never
speak
i
do
n't
feel
welcome
anymore
baby
,
what
happened
?
please
,
tell
me
'cause
,
one
second
,
it
was
perfect
now
you
're
halfway
out
the
door
and
i
stare
at
the
phone
,
he
still
has
n't
called
and
then
you
feel
so
low
you
ca
n't
feel
nothin
'
at
all
and
you
flashback
to
when
he
said
,
``
forever
and
always
,
''
oh
oh
,
and
it
rains
in
your
bedroom
,
everythin
'
is
wrong
it
rains
when
you
're
here
and
it
rains
when
you
're
gone
'cause
i
was
there
when
you
said
,
``
forever
and
always
''
was
i
out
of
line
?
did
i
say
somethin
'
way
too
honest
,
made
you
run
and
hide
like
a
scared
little
boy
?
i
looked
into
your
eyes
thought
i
knew
you
for
a
minute
,
now
i
'm
not
so
sure
so
here
's
to
everything
coming
down
to
nothin
'
here
's
to
silence
that
cuts
me
to
the
core
where
is
this
going
?
thought
i
knew
for
a
minute
,
but
i
do
n't
anymore
and
i
stare
at
the
phone
,
he
still
has
n't
called
and
then
you
feel
so
low
you
ca
n't
feel

was
there
when
you
said
,
``

and
always
''
