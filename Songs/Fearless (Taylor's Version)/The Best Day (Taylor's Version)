I
am
five
years
old,
it
is
gettin'
cold,
I
have
got
my
big
coat
on
I
hear
your
laugh
and
look
up
smilin'
at
you,
I
run
and
run
Past
the
pumpkin
patch
and
the
tractor
rides,
look,
now
the
sky
is
gold
I
hug
your
legs
and
fall
asleep
on
the
way
home
I
do
not
know
why
all
the
trees
change
in
the
fall
But
I
know
you
are
not
scared
of
anything
at
all
Don't
know
if
Snow
White's
house
is
near
or
far
away
But
I
know
I
had
the
best
day
with
you
today
I
am
thirteen
now
and
do
not
know
how
my
friends
could
be
so
mean
I
come
home
cryin'
and
you
hold
me
tight
and
grab
the
keys
And
we
drive
and
drive
until
we
found
a
town
far
enough
away
And
we
talk
and
window
shop
'til
I
have
forgotten
all
their
names
I
do
not
know
who
I
am
going
to
talk
to
now
at
school
But
I
know
I
am
laughin'
on
the
car
ride
home
with
you
Don't
know
how
long
it
is
going
to
take
to
feel
okay
But
I
know
I
had
the
best
day
with
you
today
I
have
an
excellent
father,
his
strength
is
making
me
stronger
God
smiles
on
my
little
brother,
inside
and
out,
he
is
better
than
I
am
I
grew
up
in
a
pretty
house
and
I
had
space
to
run
And
I
had
the
best
days
with
you
There
is
a
video
I
found
from
back
when
I
was
three
You
set
up
a
paint
set
in
the
kitchen
and
you
are
talkin'
to
me
It's
the
age
of
princesses
and
pirate
ships
and
the
seven
dwarves
Daddy's
smart
and
you
are
the
prettiest
lady
in
the
whole
wide
world
Now
I
know
why
all
the
trees
change
in
the
fall
I
know
you
were
on
my
side
even
when
I
was
wrong
And
I
love
you
for
givin'
me
your
eyes
For
staying
back
and
watchin'
me
shine
And
I
did
not
know
if
you
knew
So
I
am
taking
this
chance
to
say
That
I
had
the
best
day
with
you
today
