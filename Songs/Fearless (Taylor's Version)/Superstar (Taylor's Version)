This
is
wrong,
but
I
cannot
help
but
feel
like
There
are
not
nothin'
more
right,
babe
Misty
mornin'
comes
again
and
I
cannot
Help
but
wish
I
could
see
your
face
I
knew
from
the
first
note
played
I
would
be
breakin'
all
my
rules
to
see
you
You
smile
that
beautiful
smile
And
all
the
girls
in
the
front
row
Scream
your
name
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
cannot
keep
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I
am
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
Mornin'
loneliness
comes
around
when
I
am
not
Dreamin'
about
you
When
my
world
wakes
up
today
You'll
be
in
another
town
And
I
knew
when
I
saw
your
face
I
would
be
counting
down
the
ways
to
see
you
You
smile
that
beautiful
smile
And
all
the
girls
in
the
front
row
Scream
your
name
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
cannot
take
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I
am
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
You
played
in
bars,
you
play
guitar
I
am
invisible
and
everyone
knows
who
you
are
And
you
will
never
see,
you
sing
me
to
sleep
Every
night
from
the
radio
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
cannot
take
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I
am
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
Sweet,
sweet
superstar
