This
is
wrong,
but
I
can't
help
but
feel
like
There
ain't
nothin'
more
right,
babe
Misty
mornin'
comes
again
and
I
can't
Help
but
wish
I
could
see
your
face
I
knew
from
the
first
note
played
I'd
be
breakin'
all
my
rules
to
see
you
[Pre-Chorus]
You
smile
that
beautiful
smile
And
all
the
girls
in
the
front
row
Scream
your
name
[Chorus]
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
can't
keep
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I'm
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
[Verse
2]
Mornin'
loneliness
comes
around
when
I'm
not
Dreamin'
about
you
When
my
world
wakes
up
today
You'll
be
in
another
town
And
I
knew
when
I
saw
your
face
I'd
be
counting
down
the
ways
to
see
you
[Pre-Chorus]
You
smile
that
beautiful
smile
And
all
the
girls
in
the
front
row
Scream
your
name
[Chorus]
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
can't
take
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I'm
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
[Bridge]
You
played
in
bars,
you
play
guitar
I'm
invisible
and
everyone
knows
who
you
are
And
you'll
never
see,
you
sing
me
to
sleep
Every
night
from
the
radio
[Chorus]
So
dim
that
spotlight,
tell
me
things
like
"I
can't
take
my
eyes
off
of
you"
I'm
no
one
special,
just
another
wide-eyed
girl
Who's
desperately
in
love
with
you
Give
me
a
photograph
to
hang
on
my
wall
Superstar
[Outro]
Sweet,
sweet
superstar
