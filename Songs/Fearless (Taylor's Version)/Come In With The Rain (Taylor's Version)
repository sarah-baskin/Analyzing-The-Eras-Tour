I
could
go
back
to
every
laugh
But
I
do
not
want
to
go
there
anymore
And
I
know
all
the
steps
up
to
your
door
But
I
do
not
want
to
go
there
anymore
Talk
to
the
wind,
talk
to
the
sky
Talk
to
the
man
with
the
reasons
why
And
let
me
know
what
you
find
I
will
leave
my
window
open
'Cause
I
am
too
tired
at
night
to
call
your
name
Just
know,
I
am
right
here
hopin'
That
you
will
come
in
with
the
rain
I
could
stand
up
and
sing
you
a
song
But
I
do
not
want
to
have
to
go
that
far
And
I,
I
have
got
you
down,
I
know
you
by
heart
And
you
do
not
even
know
where
I
start
Talk
to
yourself,
talk
to
the
tears
Talk
to
the
man
who
put
you
here
And
do
not
wait
for
the
sky
to
clear
I
will
leave
my
window
open
'Cause
I
am
too
tired
at
night
to
call
your
name,
oh
Just
know,
I
am
right
here
hopin'
That
you
will
come
in
with
the
rain
I
have
watched
you
so
long
Screamed
your
name
I
do
not
know
what
else
I
can
say
I
will
leave
my
window
open
'Cause
I
am
too
tired
at
night
for
all
these
games
Just
know,
I
am
right
here
hopin'
That
you
will
come
in
with
the
rain
I
could
go
back
to
every
laugh
But
I
do
not
want
to
go
there
anymore
