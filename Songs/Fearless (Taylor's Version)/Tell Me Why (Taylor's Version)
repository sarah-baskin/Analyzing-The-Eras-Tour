I
took
a
chance,
I
took
a
shot
And
you
might
think
I
am
bulletproof,
but
I
am
not
You
took
a
swing,
I
took
it
hard
And
down
here
from
the
ground,
I
see
who
you
are
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
your
attitude
I
am
feelin'
like
I
do
not
know
you
You
tell
me
that
you
love
me,
then
cut
me
down
And
I
need
you
like
a
heartbeat
But
you
know
you
got
a
mean
streak
Makes
me
run
for
cover
when
you
are
around
Here's
to
you
and
your
temper
Yes,
I
remember
what
you
said
last
night
And
I
know
that
you
see
what
you
are
doing
to
me
Tell
me
why
Well,
you
could
write
a
book
on
How
to
ruin
someone
is
perfect
day
Well,
I
get
so
confused
and
frustrated
Forget
what
I
am
trying
to
say,
oh-oh
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
your
reasons
I
got
no
one
to
believe
in
You
tell
me
that
you
want
me,
then
push
me
around
And
I
need
you
like
a
heartbeat
But
you
know
you
got
a
mean
streak
Makes
me
run
for
cover
when
you
are
around
Here's
to
you
and
your
temper
Yes,
I
remember
what
you
said
last
night
And
I
know
that
you
see
what
you
are
doing
to
me
Tell
me
why
Why
do
you
have
to
make
me
feel
small
So
you
can
feel
whole
inside?
Why
do
you
have
to
put
down
my
dreams
So
you
are
the
only
thing
on
my
mind?
Well,
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
your
attitude
Feelin'
like
I
do
not
know
you
You
tell
me
that
you
want
me
and
cut
me
down
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
your
reasons
I
have
got
no
one
to
believe
in
You
ask
me
for
my
love,
then
you
push
me
around
Here's
to
you
and
your
temper
Yes,
I
remember
what
you
said
last
night
And
I
know
that
you
see
what
you
are
doing
to
me
Tell
me
why
Why
Tell
me
why,
oh
I
take
a
step
back,
I
let
you
go
I
told
you
I
am
not
bulletproof,
now
you
know
