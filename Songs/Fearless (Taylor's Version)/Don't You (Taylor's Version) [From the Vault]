Hey,
I
knew
I
would
run
into
you
somewhere
It's
been
a
while,
I
did
not
mean
to
stare
I
heard
she
is
nothin'
like
me
I
am
sure
she
will
make
you
happy
But
do
not
you
Don't
you
smile
at
me
and
ask
me
how
I
have
been
Don't
you
say
you
have
missed
me
if
you
do
not
want
me
again
You
do
not
know
how
much
I
feel
I
love
you
still
So
why
do
not
you,
do
not
you?
Sometimes,
I
really
wish
that
I
could
hate
you
I
have
tried,
but
that
is
just
somethin'
I
cannot
do
My
heart
knows
what
the
truth
is
I
swore
I
would
not
do
this
But
do
not
you
Don't
you
smile
at
me
and
ask
me
how
I
have
been
Don't
you
say
you
have
missed
me
if
you
do
not
want
me
again
You
do
not
know
how
much
I
feel
I
love
you
still
So
why
do
not
you,
do
not
you?
So
I
will
walk
out
of
here
tonight
Try
to
go
on
with
my
life
And
you
can
say
we
are
still
friends
(But
I
do
not
want
to
pretend)
So
if
I
see
you
again
Don't
you
(Don't
you)
Don't
you
smile
at
me
and
ask
me
how
I
have
been
Don't
you
(Don't
you)
say
you
have
missed
me
if
you
do
not
want
me
again
You
do
not
(You
don't)
know
how
much
I
feel
I
love
you
still
So
why
do
not
you,
do
not
you?
Don't
you
