All
this
time,
I
was
wastin',
hopin'
you
would
come
around
I've
been
givin'
out
chances
every
time
and
all
you
do
is
let
me
down
And
it's
taken
me
this
long,
baby,
but
I've
figured
you
out
And
you're
thinkin'
we'll
be
fine
again,
but
not
this
time
around
[Chorus]
You
don't
have
to
call
anymore
I
won't
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
Don't
wanna
hurt
anymore
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you're
sorry
But
I
don't
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no,
no,
no
[Verse
2]
You're
lookin'
so
innocent,
I
might
believe
you
if
I
didn't
know
Could've
loved
you
all
my
life
if
you
hadn't
left
me
waitin'
in
the
cold
And
you've
got
your
share
of
secrets
and
I'm
tired
of
bein'
last
to
know,
oh
And
now
you're
askin'
me
to
listen
'cause
it's
worked
each
time
before
[Chorus]
But
you
don't
have
to
call
anymore
I
won't
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
Don't
wanna
hurt
anymore
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you're
sorry
But
I
don't
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
[Bridge]
You
had
me
crawlin'
for
you,
honey,
and
it
never
would've
gone
away,
no
You
used
to
shine
so
bright,
but
I
watched
all
of
it
fade
[Chorus]
So
you
don't
have
to
call
anymore
I
won't
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
There's
nothin'
left
to
beg
for
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you're
sorry
But
I
don't
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
[Outro]
No,
no,
no,
no,
no
No,
no,
no
No,
no,
no,
no
Woah,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh,
no,
no,
no
No,
no
