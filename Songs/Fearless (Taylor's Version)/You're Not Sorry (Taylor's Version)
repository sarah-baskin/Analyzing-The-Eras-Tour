All
this
time,
I
was
wastin',
hopin'
you
would
come
around
I
have
been
givin'
out
chances
every
time
and
all
you
do
is
let
me
down
And
it
is
taken
me
this
long,
baby,
but
I
have
figured
you
out
And
you
are
thinkin'
we
will
be
fine
again,
but
not
this
time
around
You
do
not
have
to
call
anymore
I
will
not
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
Don't
want
to
hurt
anymore
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you
are
sorry
But
I
do
not
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no,
no,
no
You're
lookin'
so
innocent,
I
might
believe
you
if
I
did
not
know
Could've
loved
you
all
my
life
if
you
had
not
left
me
waitin'
in
the
cold
And
you
have
got
your
share
of
secrets
and
I
am
tired
of
bein'
last
to
know,
oh
And
now
you
are
askin'
me
to
listen
because
it
is
worked
each
time
before
But
you
do
not
have
to
call
anymore
I
will
not
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
Don't
want
to
hurt
anymore
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you
are
sorry
But
I
do
not
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
You
had
me
crawlin'
for
you,
honey,
and
it
never
would
have
gone
away,
no
You
used
to
shine
so
bright,
but
I
watched
all
of
it
fade
So
you
do
not
have
to
call
anymore
I
will
not
pick
up
the
phone
This
is
the
last
straw
There's
nothin'
left
to
beg
for
And
you
can
tell
me
that
you
are
sorry
But
I
do
not
believe
you,
baby,
like
I
did
before
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
You're
not
sorry
No,
no
No,
no,
no,
no,
no
No,
no,
no
No,
no,
no,
no
Woah,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh,
no,
no,
no
No,
no
