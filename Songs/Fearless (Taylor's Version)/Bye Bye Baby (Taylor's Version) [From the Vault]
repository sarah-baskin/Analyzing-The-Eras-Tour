it
was
n't
just
like
a
movie
the
rain
did
n't
soak
through
my
clothes
,
down
to
my
skin
i
'm
drivin
'
away
and
i
,
i
guess
you
could
say
this
is
the
last
time
i
'll
drive
this
way
again
lost
in
the
gray
and
i
try
to
grab
at
the
fray
'cause
i
,
i
still
love
you
,
but
i
ca
n't
bye
,
bye
to
everything
i
thought
was
on
my
side
bye
,
bye
,
baby
i
want
you
bad
,
but
it
's
come
down
to
nothing
and
all
i
have
is
your
sympathy
'cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
n't
keep
me
bye
,
bye
,
baby
bye
,
bye
,
baby
the
picture
frame
is
empty
on
the
dresser
,
vacant
just
like
me
i
see
your
writing
on
the
dash
then
back
to
your
hesitation
i
was
so
sure
of
everything
everything
i
thought
we
'd
always
have
guess
i
never
doubted
it
then
the
here
and
the
now
floods
in
feels
like
i
'm
becoming
a
part
of
your
past
bye
,
bye
to
everything
i
thought
was
on
my
side
bye
,
bye
,
baby
i
want
you
bad
,
but
it
's
come
down
to
nothing
and
all
i
have
is
your
sympathy
'cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
n't
keep
me
bye
,
bye
,
baby
and
there
's
so
much
that
i
ca
n't
touch
you
're
all
i
want
,
but
it
's
not
enough
this
time
and
all
the
pages
are
just
slipping
through
my
hands
and
i
'm
so
scared
of
how
this
ends
bye
,
bye
to
everything
i
thought
was
on
my
side
bye
,
bye
,
baby
i
want
you
bad
