It
was
not
just
like
a
movie
The
rain
did
not
soak
through
my
clothes,
down
to
my
skin
I
am
drivin'
away
and
I,
I
guess
you
could
say
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
drive
this
way
again
Lost
in
the
gray
and
I
try
to
grab
at
the
fray
'Cause
I,
I
still
love
you,
but
I
cannot
Bye,
bye
to
everything
I
thought
was
on
my
side
Bye,
bye,
baby
I
want
you
bad,
but
it
is
come
down
to
nothing
And
all
I
have
is
your
sympathy
'Cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
not
keep
me
Bye,
bye,
baby
Bye,
bye,
baby
The
picture
frame
is
empty
On
the
dresser,
vacant
just
like
me
I
see
your
writing
on
the
dash
Then
back
to
your
hesitation
I
was
so
sure
of
everything
Everything
I
thought
we
would
always
have
Guess
I
never
doubted
it
Then
the
here
and
the
now
floods
in
Feels
like
I
am
becoming
a
part
of
your
past
Bye,
bye
to
everything
I
thought
was
on
my
side
Bye,
bye,
baby
I
want
you
bad,
but
it
is
come
down
to
nothing
And
all
I
have
is
your
sympathy
'Cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
not
keep
me
Bye,
bye,
baby
And
there
is
so
much
that
I
cannot
touch
You're
all
I
want,
but
it
is
not
enough
this
time
And
all
the
pages
are
just
slipping
through
my
hands
And
I
am
so
scared
of
how
this
ends
Bye,
bye
to
everything
I
thought
was
on
my
side
Bye,
bye,
baby
I
want
you
bad,
but
it
is
come
down
to
nothing
And
all
I
have
is
your
sympathy
'Cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
not
keep
me
Bye,
bye
to
everything
I
thought
was
on
my
side
Bye,
bye,
baby
I
want
you
bad,
but
it
is
come
down
to
nothing
And
all
I
have
is
your
sympathy
'Cause
you
took
me
home
but
you
just
could
not
keep
me
Oh,
you
took
me
home,
I
thought
you
were
going
to
keep
me
Bye,
bye,
baby
Bye,
bye,
baby
