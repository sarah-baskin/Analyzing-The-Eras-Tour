Say
you
are
sorry,
that
face
of
an
angel
Comes
out
just
when
you
need
it
to
As
I
paced
back
and
forth
all
this
time
'Cause
I
honestly
believed
in
you
Holdin'
on,
the
days
drag
on
Stupid
girl,
I
shoulda
known,
I
shoulda
known
That
I
am
not
a
princess,
this
are
not
a
fairytale
I
am
not
the
one
you
will
sweep
off
her
feet,
lead
her
up
the
stairwell
This
are
not
Hollywood,
this
is
a
small
town
I
was
a
dreamer
before
you
went
and
let
me
down
Now
it
is
too
late
for
you
and
your
white
horse
To
come
around
Maybe
I
was
naive,
got
lost
in
your
eyes
And
never
really
had
a
chance
Well,
my
mistake,
I
did
not
know
to
be
in
love
You
had
to
fight
to
have
the
upper
hand
I
had
so
many
dreams
about
you
and
me
Happy
endings,
well
now
I
know
That
I
am
not
a
princess,
this
are
not
a
fairytale
I
am
not
the
one
you
will
sweep
off
her
feet,
lead
her
up
the
stairwell
This
are
not
Hollywood,
this
is
a
small
town
I
was
a
dreamer
before
you
went
and
let
me
down
Now
it
is
too
late
for
you
and
your
white
horse
To
come
around
And
there
you
are
on
your
knees
Beggin'
for
forgiveness,
beggin'
for
me
Just
like
I
always
wanted
But
I
am
so
sorry
'Cause
I
am
not
your
princess,
this
are
not
our
fairytale
I
am
going
to
find
someone
someday
Who
might
actually
treat
me
well
This
is
a
big
world,
that
was
a
small
town
There
in
my
rearview
mirror
disappearing
now
And
it
is
too
late
for
you
and
your
white
horse
Now
it
is
too
late
for
you
and
your
white
horse
To
catch
me
now
Oh,
woah,
woah,
woah
Try
and
catch
me
now,
oh
It's
too
late
to
catch
me
now
