Mmm,
mmm
Mmm,
mmm
Mmm,
yeah
Hey
Stephen,
I
know
looks
can
be
deceivin'
But
I
know
I
saw
a
light
in
you
And
as
we
walked,
we
were
talkin'
I
did
not
say
half
the
things
I
wanted
to
Of
all
the
girls
tossing
rocks
at
your
window
I
will
be
the
one
waiting
there
even
when
it
is
cold
Hey
Stephen,
boy,
you
might
have
me
believin'
I
do
not
always
have
to
be
alone
'Cause
I
cannot
help
it
if
you
look
like
an
angel
Can't
help
it
if
I
want
to
kiss
you
in
the
rain,
so
Come
feel
this
magic
I
have
been
feelin'
since
I
met
you
Can't
help
it
if
there
is
no
one
else
Mmm,
I
cannot
help
myself
Mm,
mmm
Oh-woah,
mmm
Hey
Stephen,
I
have
been
holdin'
back
this
feelin'
So
I
have
got
some
things
to
say
to
you,
huh
I
have
seen
it
all,
so
I
thought
But
I
never
seen
nobody
shine
the
way
you
do
The
way
you
walk,
way
you
talk,
way
you
say
my
name
It's
beautiful,
wonderful,
do
not
you
ever
change
Hey
Stephen,
why
are
people
always
leavin'?
I
think
you
and
I
should
stay
the
same
'Cause
I
cannot
help
it
if
you
look
like
an
angel
Can't
help
it
if
I
want
to
kiss
you
in
the
rain,
so
Come
feel
this
magic
I
have
been
feelin'
since
I
met
you
Can't
help
it
if
there
is
no
one
else
Mmm,
I
cannot
help
myself
Mmm,
mmm
They're
dimming
the
street
lights
You're
perfect
for
me
Why
are
not
you
here
tonight?
I
am
waitin'
alone
now
So
come
on
and
come
out
And
pull
me
near
And
shine,
shine,
shine
Hey
Stephen,
I
could
give
you
fifty
reasons
Why
I
should
be
the
one
you
choose
All
those
other
girls,
well,
they
are
beautiful
But
would
they
write
a
song
for
you?
Haha
I
cannot
help
it
if
you
look
like
an
angel
Can't
help
it
if
I
want
to
kiss
you
in
the
rain,
so
Come
feel
this
magic
I
have
been
feelin'
since
I
met
you
Can't
help
it
if
there
is
no
one
else
Mmm,
I
cannot
help
myself
If
you
look
like
an
angel
Can't
help
it
if
I
want
to
kiss
you
in
the
rain,
so
Come
feel
this
magic
I
have
been
feelin'
since

met
you
Can't

myself
Oh-oh,

help
myself,
