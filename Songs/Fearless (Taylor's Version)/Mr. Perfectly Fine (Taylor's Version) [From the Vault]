Mr.
"Perfect
face,"
Mr.
"Here
to
stay"
Mr.
"Looked
me
in
the
eye
and
told
me
you
would
never
go
away"
Everything
was
right,
Mr.
"I've
been
waitin'
for
you
all
my
life"
Mr.
"Every
single
day
until
the
end,
I
will
be
by
your
side"
But
that
was
when
I
got
to
know
Mr.
"Change
of
heart"
Mr.
"Leaves
me
all
alone,"
I
fall
apart
It
takes
everything
in
me
just
to
get
up
each
day
But
it
is
wonderful
to
see
that
you
are
okay
Hello,
Mr.
"Perfectly
fine"
How's
your
heart
after
breakin'
mine?
Mr.
"Always
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time,"
baby
Hello,
Mr.
"Casually
cruel"
Mr.
"Everything
revolves
around
you"
I
have
been
Miss
Misery
since
your
goodbye
And
you
are
Mr.
"Perfectly
fine"
Mr.
"Never
told
me
why,"
Mr.
"Never
had
to
see
me
cry"
Mr.
"Insincere
apology,
so
he
does
not
look
like
the
bad
guy"
He
goes
about
his
day,
forgets
he
ever
even
heard
my
name
Well,
I
thought
you
might
be
different
than
the
rest,
I
guess
you
are
all
the
same
Because
I
hear
he
is
got
his
arm
'round
a
brand-new
girl
I
have
been
pickin'
up
my
heart,
he
is
been
pickin'
up
her
And
I
never
got
past
what
you
put
me
through
But
it
is
wonderful
to
see
that
it
never
phased
you

Hello,

Mr.
"Everything
revolves
around
you"
I
have
been
Miss
Misery
since
your
goodbye
And
you
are
Mr.
"Perfectly
fine"
So
dignified
in
your
well-pressed
suit
So
strategized,
all
the
eyes
on
you
Sashay
your
way
to
your
seat
It's
the
best
seat
in
the
best
room
Oh,
he
is
so
smug,
Mr.
"Always
wins"
So
far
above
me
in
every
sense
So
far
above
feelin'
anything
And
it
is
really
such
a
shame
It's
such
a
shame
'Cause
I
was
Miss
"Here
to
stay"
Now
I
am
Miss
"Gonna
be
alright
someday"
And
someday,
maybe
you
will
miss
me
But
by
then,
you
will
be
Mr.
"Too
late"
Goodbye,
Mr.

fine"

fine
Mr.

You
said
you
would
never
go
away
