I
do
not
like
your
little
games
Don't
like
your
tilted
stage
The
role
you
made
me
play
Of
the
fool,
no,
I
do
not
like
you
I
do
not
like
your
perfect
crime
How
you
laugh
when
you
lie
You
said
the
gun
was
mine
Isn't
cool,
no,
I
do
not
like
you
(Oh)
But
I
got
smarter,
I
got
harder
in
the
nick
of
time
Honey,
I
rose
up
from
the
dead,
I
do
it
all
the
time
I
have
got
a
list
of
names
and
yours
is
in
red,
underlined
I
check
it
once,
then
I
check
it
twice,
oh
Ooh,
look
what
you
made
me
do
Look
what
you
made
me
do
Look
what
you
just
made
me
do
Look
what
you
just
made
me
Ooh,
look
what
you
made
me
do
Look
what
you
made
me
do
Look
what
you
just
made
me
do
Look
what
you
just
made
me
do
I
(I)
do
not
(Don't)
like
your
kingdom
keys
(Keys)
They
(They)
once
belonged
to
me
(Me)
You
(You)
asked
me
for
a
place
to
sleep
Locked
me
out
and
threw
a
feast
(What?)
The
world
moves
on,
another
day,
another
drama,
drama
But
not
for
me,
not
for
me,
all
I
think
about
is
karma
And
then
the
world
moves
on,
but
one
thing's
for
sure
Maybe
I
got
mine,
but
you
will
all
get
yours
But
I
got
smarter,
I
got
harder
in
the
nick
of
time
(Nick
of
time)
Honey,
I
rose
up
from
the
dead,
I

the

I

not
trust
nobody
and

I
will
be

starrin'
in
your

(Ooh,
look

made
me
do)
(Look

(Look

"Why?
Oh,
