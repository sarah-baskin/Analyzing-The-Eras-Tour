There's
glitter
on
the
floor
after
the
party
Girls
carryin'
their
shoes
down
in
the
lobby
Candle
wax
and
Polaroids
on
the
hardwood
floor
You
and
me
from
the
night
before,
but
Don't
read
the
last
page
But
I
stay
when
you
are
lost
and
I
am
scared
and
you
are
turnin'
away
I
want
your
midnights
But
I
will
be
cleanin'
up
bottles
with
you
on
New
Year's
Day
You
squeeze
my
hand
three
times
in
the
back
of
the
taxi
I
can
tell
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
long
road
I
will
be
there
if
you
are
the
toast
of
the
town,
babe
Or
if
you
strike
out
and
you
are
crawlin'
home
Don't
read
the
last
page
But
I
stay
when
it
is
hard
or
it
is
wrong
or
we
are
makin'
mistakes
I
want
your
midnights
But
I
will
be
cleanin'
up
bottles
with
you
on
New
Year's
Day
Hold
on
to
the
memories,
they
will
hold
on
to
you
Hold
on
to
the
memories,
they
will
hold
on
to
you
Hold
on
to
the
memories,
they
will
hold
on
to
you
And
I
will
hold
on
to
you
Please,
do
not
ever
become
a
stranger
Whose
laugh
I
could
recognize
anywhere
Please,
do
not
