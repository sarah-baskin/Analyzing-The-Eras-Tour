I
never
trust
a
narcissist,
but
they
love
me
So
I
play
them
like
a
violin
And
I
make
it
look,
oh,
so
easy
'Cause
for
every
lie
I
tell
them,
they
tell
me
three
This
is
how
the
world
works
Now
all
he
thinks
about
is
me
I
can
feel
the
flames
on
my
skin
Crimson
red
paint
on
my
lips
If
a
man
talks
shit,
then
I
owe
him
nothin'
I
do
not
regret
it
one
bit
because
he
had
it
comin'
They
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
Then
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
They
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
But
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
Most
fun
I
ever
had
And
I
would
do
it
over
and
over
and
over
again
if
I
could
It
just
felt
so
good,
good
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da,
da,
da
I
never
trust
a
playboy,
but
they
love
me
So
I
fly
them
all
around
the
world
And
I
let
them
think
they
saved
me
They
never
see
it
comin',
what
I
do
next
This
is
how
the
world
works
You
got
to
leave
before
you
get
left
I
can
feel
the
flames
on
my
skin
He
says,
"Don't
throw
away
a
good
thing"
But
if
he
drops
my
name,
then
I
owe
him
nothin'
And
if
he
spends
my
change,
then
he
had
it
comin'
They
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
(Da-da)
Then
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
They
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
But
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
Most
fun
I
ever
had
And
I
would
do
it
over
and
over
and
over
again
if
I
could
It
just
felt
so
good,
good
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
(It
just
felt
so
good)
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da,
da,
da
They're
burning
all
the
witches,
even
if
you
are
not
one
They
got
their
pitchforks
and
proof,
their
receipts
and
reasons
They're
burning
all
the
witches,
even
if
you
are
not
one
So

me
up

me
up),
light
me

Light
me

go
ahead
and
light
me

They

somethin'
bad
(Oh)
Then
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
(So

They
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
But
why
is
it
feel
so
(Good)

Most
fun
I
ever
had
(Most

And
I
would

Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
(Bad)
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Oh,
they
say
I
did
somethin'
bad
(They
say
I
did
somethin'

Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Then
why
is
it
feel
so

good?
So
good
(Bad),
why
is
it
feel
so
good?
Why's

feel,
why
is
it
feel
so
good?

It
just
felt
so
good,
