I
am
perfectly
fine,
I
live
on
my
own
I
made
up
my
mind,
I
am
better
off
bein'
alone
We
met
a
few
weeks
ago
Now
you
try
on
callin'
me
"baby"
like
tryin'
on
clothes
Salute
to
me,
I
am
your
American
queen
And
you
move
to
me
like
I
am
a
Motown
beat
And
we
rule
the
kingdom
inside
my
room
'Cause
all
the
boys
and
their
expensive
cars
With
their
Range
Rovers
and
their
Jaguars
Never
took
me
quite
where
you
do
And
all
at
once,
you
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin'
for
King
of
my
heart,
body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once,
you
are
all
I
want,
I
will
never
let
you
go
King
of
my
heart,
body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once
I
have
been
waitin',
waitin'
Woah,
woah
And
all
at
once
You
are
the
one,
I
have
been
waitin',
waitin'
Body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once
Late
in
the
night,
the
city's
asleep
Your
love
is
a
secret
I
am
hoping,
dreaming,
dying
to
keep
Change
my
priorities
The
taste
of
your
lips
is
my
idea
of
luxury
Salute
to
me,
I
am
your
American
queen
And
you
move
to
me
like
I
am
a
Motown
beat
And
we
rule
the
kingdom
inside
my
room
(Inside
my
room,
oh)
'Cause
all
the
boys
and
their
expensive
cars
With
their
Range
Rovers
and
their
Jaguars
Never
took
me
quite
where
you
do
(Where
you
do)
And
all
at
once,
you
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin'
for
King
of
my
heart,
body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once,
you
are
all
I
want,
I
will
never
let
you
go
King
of
my
heart
(My
heart),
body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once
(Hey)
I
have
been
waitin',
waitin'
(Waiting)
Woah,
woah
And
all
at
once
You
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin'
(Waitin'),
waitin'
(Waitin')
Body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once
Is
this
the
end
of
all
the
endings?
My
broken
bones
are
mending
With
all
these
nights
we
are
spending
Up
on
the
roof
with
a
school
girl
crush
Drinkin'
beer
out
of
plastic
cups
Say
you
fancy
me,
not
fancy
stuff
Baby,
all
at
once,
this
is
enough
And
all
at
once,
you
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin'
for
King
of
my
heart,
body
and
soul,
woah
(And
all
at
once)
And
all
at
once,
you
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin'
for
King
of
my
heart,
body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once,
you
are
all
I
want,
I
will
never
let
you
go
King
of
my
heart
(My
heart),
body
and
soul
(My
soul),
woah
And
all
at
once
I
have
been
waitin',
waitin'
Woah,
woah
(Woah)
And
all
at
once
You
are
the
one
I
have
been
waitin',
waitin'
Body
and
soul,
woah
And
all
at
once
