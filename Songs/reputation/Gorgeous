Gorgeous
You
should
take
it
as
a
compliment
That
I
got
drunk
and
made
fun
of
the
way
you
talk
You
should
think
about
the
consequence
Of
your
magnetic
field
bein'
a
little
too
strong
And
I
got
a
boyfriend,
he
is
older
than
us
He's
in
the
club
doin'
I
do
not
know
what
You're
so
cool,
it
makes
me
hate
you
so
much
(I
hate
you
so
much)
Whisky
on
ice,
Sunset
and
Vine
You've
ruined
my
life
by
not
bein'
mine
You're
so
gorgeous
I
cannot
say
anything
to
your
face
'Cause
look
at
your
face
(Gorgeous)
And
I
am
so
furious
At
you
for
makin'
me
feel
this
way
But
what
can
I
say?
You're
gorgeous
You
should
take
it
as
a
compliment
That
I
am
talkin'
to
everyone
here
but
you
(But
you,
but
you)
And
you
should
think
about
the
consequence
Of
you
touchin'
my
hand
in
a
darkened
room
(Dark
room,
dark
room)
If
you
have
got
a
girlfriend,
I
am
jealous
of
her
But
if
you
are
single,
that
is
honestly
worse
'Cause
you
are
so
gorgeous
it
actually
hurts
(Honey,
it
hurts)
Ocean
blue
eyes
lookin'
in
mine
I
feel
like
I
might
sink
and
drown
and
die
You're
so
gorgeous
I
cannot
say
anything
to
your
face
(To
your
face)
'Cause
look
at
your
face
(Look
at
your
face;
Gorgeous)
And
I
am
so
furious
At
you
for
makin'
me
feel
this
way
(Feel
this
way)
But
what
can
I
say?
You're
gorgeous
You
make
me
so
happy
it
turns
back
to
sad
(Yeah)
There's
nothin'
I
hate
more
than
what
I
cannot
have
(And)
You
are
so
gorgeous,
it
makes
me
so
mad
(Mm)
You
make
me
so
happy
it
turns
back
to
sad
(Yeah)
There's
nothin'
I
hate
more
than
what
I
cannot
have
(And)
Guess
I
will
just
stumble
on
home
to
my
cats
(Ugh)
alone
Unless
you
want
to
come
along
(Oh)
You're
so
gorgeous
(Gorgeous)
I
cannot
say
anything
to
your
face
(To
your
face)
'Cause
look
at
your
face
(Look

And
I
am
