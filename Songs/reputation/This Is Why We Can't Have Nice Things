It
was
so
nice
throwin'
big
parties
Jump
into
the
pool
from
the
balcony
Everyone
swimmin'
in
a
champagne
sea
And
there
are
no
rules
when
you
show
up
here
Bass
beat
rattling
the
chandelier
Feelin'
so
Gatsby
for
that
whole
year
So
why
did
you
have
to
rain
on
my
parade?
I
am
shaking
my
head
and
locking
the
gates
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things,
darlin'
Because
you
break
them,
I
had
to
take
them
away
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things,
honey
(Oh)
Did
you
think
I
would
not
hear
all
the
things
you
said
about
me?
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things
It
was
so
nice
being
friends
again
There
I
was,
giving
you
a
second
chance
But
you
stabbed
me
in
the
back
while
shakin'
my
hand
And
therein
lies
the
issue,
friends
do
not
try
to
trick
you
Get
you
on
the
phone
and
mind-twist
you
And
so
I
took
an
axe
to
a
mended
fence
But
I
am
not
the
only
friend
you
have
lost
lately
(Mm-mm)
If
only
you
were
not
so
shady
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things,
darlin'
(Yeah)
Because
you
break
them,
I
had
to
take
them
away
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
(Nice
things)
things
(Baby),
honey
Did
you
think
I
would
not
hear
all
the
things
you
said
about
me?
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
Here's
a
toast
to
my
real
friends
They
do
not
care
about
the
he-said,
she-said
And
here
is
to
my
baby
He
are
not
readin'
what
they
call
me
lately
And
here
is
to
my
mama
Had
to
listen
to
all
this
drama
And
here
is
to
you
'Cause
forgiveness
is
a
nice
thing
to
do
Haha,
I
cannot
even
say
it
with
a
straight
face
(This
is
why
we
cannot
have)
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things,
darlin'
(Darlin')
Because
you
break
them,
I
had
to
take
them
away
(Away)
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
(Uh,
uh)
things
(Oh,
no),
honey
(Baby,
oh)
Did
you
think
I
would
not
hear
all
the
things
you
said
about
me?
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
(Oh)
nice
(Oh,
no)
things,
darlin'
(And
here
is
to
my
real
friends;
Oh)
Because
you
break
them,
I
had
to
take
them
(Away)
(And
here
is
to
my
baby;
Oh)
Nice
things
(Oh,
no),
honey
(They
did
not
care
about
that
he-said,
she-said)
Did
you
think
I
would
not
hear
all
the
things
you
said
about
me?
This
is
why
we
cannot
have
nice
things
