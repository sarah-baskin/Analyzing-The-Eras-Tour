the
Ghost
like
I
am
whippin'
a
boat
I

type
You

down
and
I

you
with
my
life
I
do
not
want
to
touch
you
(I
do
not
want
to
be)
Just
another
ex-love
(You
do
not
want
to
see)
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
(I
do
not
want
to
miss
you)
Like

other
girls

Knew
her
when
I
was
young,
reconnected
when
we
were
little
bit
older
Both
sprung,
I
got
issues
and
chips
on
both
of
my
shoulders
Reputation
precedes
me,
in
rumours,
I
am
knee-deep
The
truth
is,
it
is
easier
to
ignore
it,
believe
me
Even
when
we
would
argue,
we
would
not
do
it
for
long
And
you
understand
the
good
and
bad
end
up
in
the
song
For
all
your
beautiful
traits
and
the
way
you
do
it
with
ease
For
all
my
flaws,
paranoia
and
insecurities
I
have
made
mistakes
and
made
some
choices,
that
is
hard
to
deny
After
the
storm,
somethin'
was
born
on
the
4th
of
July
Our
past
days
were
the
fun,
this
end
game
is
the
one
With
four
words
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue,
I
will
never
say
it
I
do
not
want
to
touch
you
(I
do
not
want
to
be)
Just
another
ex-love
(You
do
not
want
to
see)
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
(I
do
not
want
to
miss
you)
Like
the
other
girls
do
I
do
not
want
to
hurt
you
(I
just
want
to
be)
Drinkin'
on
the
beach
with
(You
all
over
me)
I
know
what
they
all
say
(Yeah)
But
I
are
not
tryna
play
(Ooh)
I
want
to
be
your
end
game
(End

I
want
to
be
your
first
string
(Wanna

I
want
to
be
your
A-Team
(A-Team)
I
want

Big
reputation,

reputation
Ooh,

and
me,

got
big
reputations,

And

about
you,
ooh
You

the
bad
ones
too
I
hit
you
like
bang,
we
tried
to
forget
it,
but
we
just
could
not
And
I
bury
hatchets,
but
I
keep
maps
of
where
I
put
them
Reputation
precedes
me,
they
told
you
I
am
crazy
I
swear
I
do
not
love
the
drama,
it
loves
me
And
I
cannot
let
you
go,
your
handprints
on
my
soul
It's
like
your
eyes
are
liquor,
it
is
like
your
body
is
gold
You've
been
callin'
my
bluff
on
all
my
usual
tricks
So
here
is
the
truth
from
my
red
lips
(Ooh,

I
want
to
be
your
end
game
(End
game)

want
to

I
want
to
be
your
end
game,
end
game
I
want
to
be
your
end
game
(Oh,

do;
End
game)
I
want
to
be
your
first
string
(First

I
want
to
be
your
A-Team
(A-Team)
I
want
to
be
your
end
game,
end
game
