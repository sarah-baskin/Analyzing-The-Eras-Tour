You
should
have
been
there
Should've
burst
through
the
door
With
that
"Baby,
I
am
right
here"
smile
And
it
would
have
felt
like
A
million
little
shining
stars
that
just
align
And
I
would
have
been
so
happy
Christmas
lights
glisten
I
have
got
my
eye
on
the
door
Just
waitin'
for
you
to
walk
in
But
the
time
is
tickin'
People
ask
me
how
I
have
been
As
I
comb
back
through
my
memory
How
you
said
you
would
be
here
You
said
you
would
be
here
And
it
was
like
slow
motion
Standing
there
in
my
party
dress
In
red
lipstick
With
no
one
to
impress
And
they
are
all
laughin'
As
I
am
lookin'
around
the
room
But
there
was
one
thing
missin'
And
that
was
the
moment
I
knew
And
the
hours
pass
by
Now
I
just
want
to
be
alone
But
your
close
friends
always
seem
to
know
When
there
is
somethin'
really
wrong
So
they
follow
me
down
the
hall
And
there
in
the
bathroom
I
try
not
to
fall
apart
And
the
sinking
feelin'
starts
As
I
say
hopelessly
"He
said
he
would
be
here"
And
it
was
like
slow
motion
Standing
there
in
my
party
dress
In
red
lipstick
With
no
one
to
impress
And
they
are
all
laughin'
And
asking
me
about
you
But
there
was
one
thing
missin'
And
that
was
the
moment
I
knew
What
do
you
say
When
tears
are
streaming
down
your
face
In
front
of
everyone
you
know?
And
what
do
you
do
When
the
one
who
means
the
most
to
you
Is
the
one
who
did
not
show?
You
should
have
been
here
And
I
would
have
been
so
happy
And
it
was
like
slow
motion
Standing
there
in
my
party
dress
In
red
lipstick
With
no
one
to
impress
And
they
are
all
standin'
around
me,
singin'
"Happy
birthday
to
you"
But
there
was
one
thing
missin'
And
that
was
the
moment
I
knew
(Oh)
Oh,
I
knew
(Oh)
You
called
me
later
And
said,
"I'm
sorry
I
did
not
make
it"
And
I
said,
"I'm
sorry
too"
And
that
was
the
moment
I
knew
