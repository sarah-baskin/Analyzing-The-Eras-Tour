Once
upon
a
time,
a
few
mistakes
ago
I
was
in
your
sights,
you
got
me
alone
You
found
me,
you
found
me,
you
found
me-e-e-e-e
I
guess
you
did
not
care
and
I
guess
I
liked
that
And
when
I
fell
hard,
you
took
a
step
back
Without
me,
without
me,
without
me-e-e-e-e-e
And
he
is
long
gone
when
he
is
next
to
me
And
I
realize
the
blame
is
on
me
'Cause
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
So
shame
on
me
now
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
'Til
you
put
me
down,
oh
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
So
shame
on
me
now
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
Now
I
am
lyin'
on
the
cold
hard
ground
Oh,
oh
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
Oh,
oh
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
No
apologies,
he
will
never
see
you
cry
Pretends
he
does
not
know
that
he
is
the
reason
why
You're
drowning,
you
are
drowning,
you
are
drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And
I
heard
you
moved
on
from
whispers
on
the
street
A
new
notch
in
your
belt
is
all
I
will
ever
be
And
now
I
see,
now
I
see,
now
I
see-e-e-e-e-e
He
was
long
gone
when
he
met
me
And
I
realize
the
joke
is
on
me,
hey
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
(Oh)
So
shame
on
me
now
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
'Til
you
put
me
down,
oh
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
So
shame
on
me
now
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
(Yeah)
Now
I
am
lyin'
on
the
cold
hard
ground
Oh,
oh
(Yeah)
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
(Trouble)
Oh,
oh
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
And
the
saddest
fear
Comes
creepin'
in
That
you
never
loved
me
Or
her
or
anyone
or
anything,
yeah
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
So
shame
on
me
now
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
(Never
been)
'Til
you
put
me
down,
oh
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
(I
knew
it
right
there)
So
shame
on
me
now
(I
knew
it
right
there)
Flew
me
to
places
I
would
never
been
(Woah)
Now
I
am
lyin'
on
the
cold
hard
ground
Oh,
oh
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
(Oh)
Oh,
oh
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
(Trouble)
'Cause
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
'Cause
I
knew
you
were
trouble
when
you
walked
in
Trouble,
trouble,
trouble
