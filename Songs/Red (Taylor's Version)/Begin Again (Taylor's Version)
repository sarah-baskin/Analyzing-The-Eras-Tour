Took
a
deep
breath
in
the
mirror
He
did
not
like
it
when
I
wore
high
heels,
but
I
do
Turn
the
lock
and
put
my
headphones
on
He
always
said
he
did
not
get
this
song,
but
I
do,
I
do
I
walked
in,
expectin'
you
would
be
late
But
you
got
here
early
and
you
stand
and
wave,
I
walk
to
you
You
pull
my
chair
out
and
help
me
in
And
you
do
not
know
how
nice
that
is,
but
I
do
And
you
throw
your
head
back
laughin'
like
a
little
kid
I
think
it
is
strange
that
you
think
I
am
funny
because
he
never
did
I
have
been
spendin'
the
last
eight
months
Thinkin'
all
love
ever
does
is
break
and
burn
and
end
But
on
a
Wednesday
in
a
café,
I
watched
it
begin
again
You
said
you
never
met
one
girl
who
Had
as
many
James
Taylor
records
as
you,
but
I
do
We
tell
stories
and
you
do
not
know
why
I
am
comin'
off
a
little
shy,
but
I
do
But
you
throw
your
head
back
laughin'
like
a
little
kid
I
think
it
is
strange
that
you
think
I
am
funny
because
he
never
did
I
have
been
spendin'
the
last
eight
months
Thinkin'
all
love
ever
does
is
break
and
burn
and
end
But
on
a
Wednesday
in
a
café,
I
watched
it
begin
again
And
we
walked
down
the
block
to
my
car
And
I
almost
brought
him
up
But
you
start
to
talk
about
the
movies
That
your
family
watches
every
single
Christmas
And
I
want
to
talk
about
that
And
for
the
first
time,
what
is
past
is
past
'Cause
you
throw
your
head
back
laughin'
like
a
little
kid
I
think
it
is
strange
that
you
think
I
am
funny
because
he
never
did
I
have
been
spendin'
the
last
eight
months
Thinkin'
all
love
ever
does
is
break
and
burn
and
end
But
on
a
Wednesday
in
a
café,
I
watched
it
begin
again
On
a
Wednesday
in
a
café,
I
watched
it
begin
again
