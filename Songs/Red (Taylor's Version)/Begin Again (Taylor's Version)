took
a
deep
breath
in
the
mirror
he
did
n't
like
it
when
i
wore
high
heels
,
but
i
do
turn
the
lock
and
put
my
headphones
on
he
always
said
he
did
n't
get
this
song
,
but
i
do
,
i
do
i
walked
in
,
expectin
'
you
'd
be
late
but
you
got
here
early
and
you
stand
and
wave
,
i
walk
to
you
you
pull
my
chair
out
and
help
me
in
and
you
do
n't

how
nice
that
is
,
but
i
do
and
you
throw
your
head
back
laughin
'
like
a
little
kid
i
think
it
's
strange
that

did
i
've
been
spendin
'
the
last
eight
months
thinkin

on
a
wednesday
in
a

watched
it
begin
again

said
you
never
met
one
girl
who

as
many
james
taylor
records
as

but
i
do
we
tell
stories
and
you
do
n't
know
why
i
'm
comin
'
off
a
little
shy
,

down
the

to
my

and
