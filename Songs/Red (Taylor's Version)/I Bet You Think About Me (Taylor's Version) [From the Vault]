3
AM
and
I
am
still
awake,
I
will
bet
you
are
just
fine
Fast
asleep
in
your
city
that
is
better
than
mine
And
the
girl
in
your
bed
has
a
fine
pedigree
And
I
will
bet
your
friends
tell
you
she
is
better
than
me,
huh
Well,
I
tried
to
fit
in
with
your
upper-crust
circles
Yeah,
they
let
me
sit
in
back
when
we
were
in
love
Oh,
they
sit
around
talkin'
about
the
meaning
of
life
And
the
book
that
just
saved
them
that
I
had
not
heard
of
But
now
that
we
are
done
and
it
is
over
I
bet
you
could
not
believe
When
you
realized
I
am
harder
to
forget
than
I
was
to
leave
And
I
bet
you
think
about
me
You
grew
up
in
a
silver-spoon
gated
community
Glamorous,
shiny,
bright
Beverly
Hills
I
was
raised
on
a
farm,
no,
it
was
not
a
mansion
Just
livin'
room
dancin'
and
kitchen
table
bills
But
you
know
what
they
say,
you
cannot
help
who
you
fall
for
And
you
and
I
fell
like
an
early
spring
snow
But
reality
crept
in,
you
said
we
are
too
different
You
laughed
at
my
dreams,
rolled
your
eyes
at
my
jokes
Mr.
Superior
Thinkin'
Do
you
have
all
the
space
that
you
need?
I
do
not
have
to
be
your
shrink
to
know
that
you
will
never
be
happy
And
I
bet
you
think
about
me
I
bet
you
think
about
me,
yes
I
bet
you
think
about
me
Oh,
block
it
all
out
The
voices
so
loud,
sayin'
"Why
did
you
let
her
go?"
Does
it
make
you
feel
sad
That
the
love
that
you
are
lookin'
for
Is
the
love
that
you
had?
Now
you
are
out
in
the
world,
searchin'
for
your
soul
Scared
not
to
be
hip,
scared
to
get
old
Chasing
make-believe
status,
last
time
you
felt
free
Was
when
none
of
that
shit
mattered
because
you
were
with
me
But
now
that
we
are
done
and
it
is
over
I
bet
it
is
hard
to
believe
But
it
turned
out
I
am
harder
to
forget
than
I
was
to
leave
And,
yeah,
I
bet
you
think
about
me
I
bet
you
think
about
me,
yes
I
bet
you
think
about
me
I
bet
you
think
about
me
when
you
are
out
At
your
cool
indie
music
concerts
every
week
I
bet
you
think
about
me
in
your
house
With
your
organic
shoes
and
your
million-dollar
couch
I
bet
you
think
about
me
when
you
say
"Oh
my
god,
she
is
insane,
she
wrote
a
song
about
me"
I
bet
you
think
about
me
