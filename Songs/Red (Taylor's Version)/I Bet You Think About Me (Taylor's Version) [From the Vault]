sit
in
back
when

were
in
love

sit
around
talkin
'
about
the
meaning
of
life
and
the
book
that
just
saved
'em
that
i
had
n't
heard
of
taylor

for
your
soul
scared
not
to
be
hip
,
scared
to
get
old
chasing
make-believe
status
,
last
time
you
felt
free
was
when
none
of
that
shit
mattered
'cause
you
were
with
me

your
house
with
your
organic
shoes
and
your
million-dollar
couch
i

think
about
me
when

a
song
about
