I
remember
your
bare
feet
down
the
hallway
I
remember
your
little
laugh
Race
cars
on
the
kitchen
floor,
plastic
dinosaurs
I
love
you
to
the
Moon
and
back
I
remember
your
blue
eyes
lookin'
into
mine
Like
we
had
our
own
secret
club
I
remember
you
dancin'
before
bedtime
Then
jumpin'
on
me,
waking
me
up
I
can
still
feel
you
hold
my
hand,
little
man
And
even
the
moment
I
knew
You
fought
it
hard
like
an
army
guy
Remember
I
leaned
in
and
whispered
to
you
"Come
on,
baby,
with
me
We're
going
to
fly
away
from
here
You
were
my
best
four
years"
I
remember
the
drive
home
when
the
blind
hope
Turned
to
cryin'
and
screamin',
"Why?"
Flowers
pile
up
in
the
worst
way,
no
one
knows
what
to
say
About
a
beautiful
boy
who
died
And
it
is
about
to
be
Halloween,
you
could
be
anything
You
wanted
if
you
were
still
here
I
remember
the
last
day
when
I
kissed
your
face
And
whispered
in
your
ear
"Come
on,
baby,
with
me
We're
going
to
fly
away
from
here
Out
of
this
curtained
room
and
this
hospital
gray
We'll
just
disappear
Come
on,
baby,
with
me
We're
going
to
fly
away
from
here
You
were
my
best
four
years"
What
if
I
am
standin'
in
your
closet
trying
to
talk
to
you?
And
what
if
I
kept
the
hand-me-downs
you
will
not
grow
into?
And
what
if
I
really
thought
some
miracle
would
see
us
through?
And
what
if
the
miracle
was
even
gettin'
one
moment
with
you?
Come
on,
baby,
with
me
We're
going
to
fly
away
from
here
Come
on,
baby,
with
me
We're
going
to
fly
away
from
here
You
were
my
best
four
years
I
remember
your
bare
feet
down
the
hallway
I
love
you
to
the
Moon
and
back
