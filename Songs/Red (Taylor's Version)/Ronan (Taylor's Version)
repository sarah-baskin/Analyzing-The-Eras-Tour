i
remember
your
bare
feet
down
the
hallway
i
remember
your
little
laugh
race
cars
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
plastic
dinosaurs
i
love
you
to
the
moon
and
back
i
remember
your
blue
eyes
lookin
'
into
mine
like
we
had
our
own
secret
club
i
remember
you
dancin
'
before
bedtime
then
jumpin
'
on
me
,
waking
me
up
i
can
still
feel
you
hold
my
hand
,
little
man
and
even
the
moment
i
knew
you
fought
it
hard
like
an
army
guy
remember
i
leaned
in
and
whispered
to
you
``
come
on
,
baby
,
with
me
we
're
gon
na
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
years
''
i
remember
the
drive
home
when
the
blind
hope
turned
to
cryin
'
and
screamin
'
,
``
why
?
''
flowers
pile
up
in
the
worst
way
,
no
one
knows
what
to
say
about
a
beautiful
boy
who
died
and
it
's
about
to
be
halloween
,
you
could
be
anything
you
wanted
if
you
were
still
here
i
remember
the
last
day
when
i
kissed
your
face
and
whispered
in
your
ear
``
come
on
,
baby
,
with
me
we
're
gon
na
fly
away
from
here
out
of
this
curtained
room
and
this
hospital
gray
we
'll
just
disappear
come
on
,
baby
,
with
me
we
're
gon
na
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
years
''
what
if
i
'm
standin
'
in
your
closet
trying
to
talk
to
you
?
and
what
if
i
kept
the
hand-me-downs
you
wo
n't
grow
into
?
and
what
if
i
really
thought
some
miracle
would
see
us
through
?
and
what
if
the
miracle
was
even
gettin
'
one
moment
with
you
?
come
on
,
baby
,
with
me
we
're
gon
na
fly
away
from
here
come
on
,
baby
,
with
me
we
're
gon
na
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
years
i
remember
your
bare
feet
down
the
hallway
i
love
you
to
the
moon
and
back
