New
to
town
with
a
made-up
name
In
the
angel's
city,
chasin'
fortune
and
fame
And
the
camera
flashes
make
it
look
like
a
dream
You
had
it
figured
out
since
you
were
in
school
Everybody
loves
pretty,
everybody
loves
cool
So
overnight,
you
look
like
a
'60s
queen
Another
name
goes
up
in
lights
Like
diamonds
in
the
sky
And
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Yeah,
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
But
can
you
tell
me
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one?
Oh,
oh,
oh
And
now,
it
is
big
black
cars
and
Riviera
views
And
your
lover
in
the
foyer
does
not
even
know
you
And
your
secrets
end
up
splashed
on
the
news
front
page
And
they
tell
you
that
you
are
lucky,
but
you
are
so
confused
'Cause
you
do
not
feel
pretty,
you
just
feel
used
And
all
the
young
things
line
up
to
take
your
place
Another
name
goes
up
in
lights
You
wonder
if
you
will
make
it
out
alive
And
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Yeah,
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Can
you
tell
me
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one?
Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh
It
was
a
few
years
later,
I
showed
up
here
And
they
still
tell
the
legend
of
how
you
disappeared
How
you
took
the
money
and
your
dignity
and
got
the
hell
out
They
say
you
bought
a
bunch
of
land
somewhere
Chose
the
rose
garden
over
Madison
Square
And
it
took
some
time,
but
I
understand
it
now
'Cause
now
my
name
is
up
in
lights
But
I
think
you
got
it
right
Let
me
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Let
me
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Let
me
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Oh,
oh,
oh
Yeah,
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Yeah,
they
will
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Let
me
tell
you
now,
you
are
the
lucky
one
Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh-woah,
oh
