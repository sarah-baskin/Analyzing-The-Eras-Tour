i
'm
walkin
'
fast
through
the
traffic
lights
busy
streets
and
busy
lives
and
all
we
know
is
touch
and
go
we
are
alone
with
our
changing
minds
we
fall
in
love
'til
it
hurts
or
bleeds
or
fades
in
time
and
i
never
(
i
never
)
saw
you
comin
'
and
i
'll
never
(
i
'll
never
)
be
the
same
you
come
around
and
the
armor
falls
pierce
the
room
like
a
cannonball
now
all
we
know
is
do
n't
let
go
we
are
alone
,
just
you
and
me
up
in
your
room
and
our
slates
are
clean
just
twin
fire
signs
,
four
blue
eyes
so
you
were
never
a
saint
and
i
loved
in
shades
of
wrong
we
learn
to
live
with
the
pain
,
mosaic
broken
hearts
but
this
love
is
brave
and
wild
and
i
never
(
i
never
)
saw
you
comin
'
and
i
'll
never
(
i
'll
never
)
be
the
same
this
is
a
state
of
grace
this
is
the
worthwhile
fight
love
is
a
ruthless
game
unless
you
play
it
good
and
right
these
are
the
hands
of
fate
you
're
my
achilles
heel
this
is
the
golden
age
of
somethin
'
good
and
right
and
real
and
i
never
(
i
never
)
saw
you
comin
'
and
i
'll
never
be
the
same
,
oh-oh-oh
and
i
never
(
i
never
)
saw
you
comin
'
and
i
'll
never
(
i
'll
never
)
(
so
you
were
never
a
saint
and
i
loved
in
shades
of
wrong
