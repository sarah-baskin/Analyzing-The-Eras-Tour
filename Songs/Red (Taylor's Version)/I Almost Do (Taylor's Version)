I
bet,
this
time
of
night,
you're
still
up
I
bet
you're
tired
from
a
long,
hard
week
I
bet
you're
sittin'
in
your
chair
by
the
window
lookin'
out
at
the
city
And
I
bet
sometimes
you
wonder
'bout
me
[Chorus]
And
I
just
wanna
tell
you
It
takes
everything
in
me
not
to
call
you
And
I
wish
I
could
run
to
you
And
I
hope
you
know
that
Every
time
I
don't,
I
almost
do
I
almost
do
[Verse
2]
I
bet
you
think
I
either
moved
on
or
hate
you
'Cause
each
time
you
reach
out,
there's
no
reply
I
bet
it
never,
ever
occurred
to
you
That
I
can't
say
hello
to
you
and
risk
another
goodbye
[Chorus]
And
I
just
wanna
tell
you
It
takes
everything
in
me
not
to
call
you
And
I
wish
I
could
run
to
you
And
I
hope
you
know
that
Every
time
I
don't,
I
almost
do
I
almost
do
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
[Bridge]
Oh,
we
made
quite
a
mess,
babe
It's
probably
better
off
this
way
And
I
confess,
babe
In
my
dreams,
you're
touchin'
my
face
And
asking
me
if
I'd
wanna
try
again
with
you
And
I
almost
do
[Chorus]
And
I
just
wanna
tell
you
It
takes
everything
in
me
not
to
call
you
And
I
wish
I
could
run
to
you
And
I
hope
you
know
that
Every
time
I
don't,
I
almost
do
I
almost
do
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
[Outro]
I
bet,
this
time
of
night,
you're
still
up
I
bet
you're
tired
from
a
long,
hard
week
I
bet
you're
sittin'
in
your
chair
by
the
window
lookin'
out
at
the
city
And
I
hope
sometimes
you
wonder
'bout
me
