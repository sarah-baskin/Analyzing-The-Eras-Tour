i
was
reminiscing
just
the
other
day
while
havin
'
coffee
all
alone
and
,
lord
,
it
took
me
away
back
to
a
first-glance
feelin
'
on
new
york
time
back
when
you
fit
my
poems
like
a
perfect
rhyme
took
off
faster
than
a
green
light
,
go
yeah
,
you
skip
the
conversation
when
you
already
know
i
left
a
note
on
the
door
with
a
joke
we
'd
made
and
that
was
the
first
day
and
darlin
'
,
it
was
good
never
lookin
'
down
and
right
there
where
we
stood
was
holy
ground
spinnin
'
like
a
girl
in
a
brand
new
dress
we
had
this
big
,
wide
city
all
to
ourselves
we
block
the
noise
with
the
sound
of
,
``
i
need
you
''
and
for
the
first
time
,
i
had
something
to
lose
and
i
guess
we
fell
apart
in
the
usual
way
and
the
story
's
got
dust
on
every
page
but
,
sometimes
,
i
wonder
how
you
think
about
it
now
and
i
see
your
face
in
every
crowd
'cause
,
darlin
'
,
it
was
good
(
ooh-ayy
,
ooh-ayy
)
never
lookin
'
down
(
ooh-ayy
,
ooh-ayy
)
and
right
there
where
we
stood
(

was
holy
ground
