I
was
reminiscing
just
the
other
day
While
havin'
coffee
all
alone
and,
Lord,
it
took
me
away
Back
to
a
first-glance
feelin'
on
New
York
time
Back
when
you
fit
my
poems
like
a
perfect
rhyme
Took
off
faster
than
a
green
light,
go
Yeah,
you
skip
the
conversation
when
you
already
know
I
left
a
note
on
the
door
with
a
joke
we
would
made
And
that
was
the
first
day
And
darlin',
it
was
good
Never
lookin'
down
And
right
there
where
we
stood
Was
holy
ground
Spinnin'
like
a
girl
in
a
brand
new
dress
We
had
this
big,
wide
city
all
to
ourselves
We
block
the
noise
with
the
sound
of,
"I
need
you"
And
for
the
first
time,
I
had
something
to
lose
And
I
guess
we
fell
apart
in
the
usual
way
And
the
story's
got
dust
on
every
page
But,
sometimes,
I
wonder
how
you
think
about
it
now
And
I
see
your
face
in
every
crowd
'Cause,
darlin',
it
was
good
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
Never
lookin'
down
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
And
right
there
where
we
stood
(Ooh-ayy)
Was
holy
ground
Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
oh-woah
Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
oh-woah
Tonight,
I
am
going
to
dance
For
all
that
we
have
been
through
But
I
do
not
want
to
dance
If
I
am
not
dancin'
with
you
Tonight,
I
am
going
to
dance
Like
you
were
in
this
room
But
I
do
not
want
to
dance
If
I
am
not
dancin'
with
you
It
was
good
I
am
never
lookin'
down
And
right
there
where
we
stood
Was
holy
ground
Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
oh-woah
Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy,
oh-woah
Tonight,
I
am
going
to
dance
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
For
all
that
we
have
been
through
(Ooh-ayy,
oh-woah)
But
I
do
not
want
to
dance
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
If
I
am
not
dancin'
with
you
(Ooh-ayy,
oh-woah)
Tonight,
I
am
going
to
dance
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
Like
you
were
in
this
room
(Ooh-ayy,
oh-woah)
But
I
do
not
want
to
dance
(Ooh-ayy,
ooh-ayy)
If
I
am
not
dancin'
with
you
