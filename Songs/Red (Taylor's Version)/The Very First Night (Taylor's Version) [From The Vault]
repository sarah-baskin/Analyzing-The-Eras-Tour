I
wish
I
could
fly
I
would
pick
you
up
and
we
would
go
back
in
time
I
would
write
this
in
the
sky
I
miss
you
like
it
was
the
very
first
night
And
so
it
goes
Every
weekend,
this
same
party
I
never
go
alone
And
I
do
not
seem
broken-hearted
My
friends
all
say
they
know
Everything
I
am
going
through
I
drive
down
different
roads
But
they
all
lead
back
to
you
'Cause
they
do
not
know
about
the
night
in
the
hotel
They
were
not
ridin'
in
the
car
when
we
both
fell
Didn't
read
the
note
on
the
Polaroid
picture
They
do
not
know
how
much
I
miss
you
I
wish
I
could
fly
I
would
pick
you
up
and
we
would
go
back
in
time
I
would
write
this
in
the
sky
I
miss
you
like
it
was
the
very
first
night
And
so
it
was
We
never
saw
it
comin'
Not
trying
to
fall
in
love
But
we
did
like
children
runnin'
Back
then,
we
did
not
know
We
were
built
to
fall
apart
We
broke
the
status
quo
Then
we
broke
each
other's
hearts
But
do
not
forget
about
the
night
out
in
L.A
Dance
in
the
kitchen,
chase
me
down
through
the
hallway
No
one
knows
about
the
words
that
we
whispered
No
one
knows
how
much
I
miss
you
I
wish
I
could
fly
I
would
pick
you
up
and
we
would
go
back
in
time
I
would
write
this
in
the
sky
I
miss
you
like
it
was
the
very
first
night
Take
me
away,
take
me
away
Take
me
away
to
you,
to
you
Take
me
away,
take
me
away
Take
me
away
to
you,
to
you
I
remember
the
night
at
the
hotel
I
was
ridin'
in
the
car
when
we
both
fell
I
am
the
one
on
the
phone
as
you
whisper
"Do
you
know
how
much
I
miss
you?"
I
wish
that
we
could
go
back
in
time
And
I
would
say
to
you
"I
miss
you
like
it
was
the
very
first
night"
I
wish
I
could
fly
I
would
pick
you
up
and
we
would
go
back
in
time
I
would
write
this
in
the
sky
I
miss
you
like
it
was
the
very
first
night
Take
me
away
(Take
me),
take
me
away
(Take
me)
Take
me
away
(Take
me)
to
you,
to
you
Take
me
away
(Take
me),
take
me
away
(Take
me)
Take
me
away
(Take
me)
to
you,
to
you
