I
find
myself
at
your
door
Just
like
all
those
times
before
I
am
not
sure
how
I
got
there
All
roads,
they
lead
me
here
I
imagine
you
are
home
In
your
room,
all
alone
And
you
open
your
eyes
into
mine
And
everything
feels
better
And
right
before
your
eyes
I
am
breakin'
No
past,
no
reasons
why
Just
you
and
me
This
is
the
last
time
I
am
askin'
you
this
Put
my
name
at
the
top
of
your
list
This
is
the
last
time
I
am
askin'
you
why
You
break
my
heart
in
the
blink
of
an
eye,
eye,
eye
You
find
yourself
at
my
door
And
just
like
all
those
times
before
You
wear
your
best
apology
But
I
was
there
to
watch
you
leave
And
all
the
times
I
let
you
in
Just
for
you
to
go
again
Disappear
when
you
come
back
Everything
is
better
And
right
before
your
eyes
I
am
achin'
No
past,
nowhere
to
hide
Just
you
and
me
This
is
the
last
time
I
am
askin'
you
this
Put
my
name
at
the
top
of
your
list
This
is
the
last
time
I
am
askin'
you
why
You
break
my
heart
in
the
blink
of
an
eye,
eye,
eye
This
is
the
last
time
you
tell
me
I
have
got
it
wrong
This
is
the
last
time
I
say,
"It's
been
you
all
along"
This
is
the
last
time
I
let
you
in
my
door
This
is
the
last
time,
I
will
not
hurt
you
anymore
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
This
is
the
last
time
I
am

why
You

my
heart
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
This
is
the
last
time
I
am
askin'
you
this
(This

last
time
I
