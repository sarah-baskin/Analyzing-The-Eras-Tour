i
'm
pretty
sure
we
almost
broke
up
last
night
i
threw
my
phone
across
the
room
at
you
i
was
expecting
some
dramatic
turn
away
but
you
stayed
this
morning
,
i
said
we
should
talk
about
it
'cause
i
read
you
should
never
leave
a
fight
unresolved
that
's
when
you
came
in
wearing
a
football
helmet
and
said
,
``
okay
,
let
's
talk
''
and
i
said
,
``
stay
,
stay
,
stay
''
i
've
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time
,
time
,
time
you
think
that
it
's
funny
when
i
'm
mad
,
mad
,
mad
but
i
think
that
it
's
best
if
we
both
stay
before
you
,
i
'd
only
dated
self-indulgent
takers
who
took
all
of
their
problems
out
on
me
but
you
carry
my
groceries
and
now
i
'm
always
laughing
and
i
love
you
because
you
have
given
me
no
choice
but
to
stay
,
stay
,
stay
i
've
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time
,
time
,
time
you
think
that
it
's
funny
when
i
'm
mad
,
mad
,
mad
but
i
think
that
it
's
best
if
we
both
stay
,
stay
,
stay
,
stay
you
took
the
time
to
memorize
me
my
fears
,
my
hopes
and
dreams
i
just
like
hanging
out
with
you
all
the
time
all
those
times
that
you
did
n't
leave
it
's
been
occurring
to
me
i
'd
like
to
hang
out
with
you
for
my
whole
life
stay
and
i
'll
be
loving
you
for
quite
some
time
no
