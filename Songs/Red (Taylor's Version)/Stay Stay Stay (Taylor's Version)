I
am
pretty
sure
we
almost
broke
up
last
night
I
threw
my
phone
across
the
room
at
you
I
was
expecting
some
dramatic
turn
away
But
you
stayed
This
morning,
I
said
we
should
talk
about
it
'Cause
I
read
you
should
never
leave
a
fight
unresolved
That's
when
you
came
in
wearing
a
football
helmet
And
said,
"Okay,
let
us
talk"
And
I
said,
"Stay,
stay,
stay"
I
have
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time,
time,
time
You
think
that
it
is
funny
when
I
am
mad,
mad,
mad
But
I
think
that
it
is
best
if
we
both
stay
Before
you,
I
would
only
dated
self-indulgent
takers
Who
took
all
of
their
problems
out
on
me
But
you
carry
my
groceries
and
now
I
am
always
laughing
And
I
love
you
because
you
have
given
me
No
choice
but
to
stay,
stay,
stay
I
have
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time,
time,
time
You
think
that
it
is
funny
when
I
am
mad,
mad,
mad
But
I
think
that
it
is
best
if
we
both
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay
You
took
the
time
to
memorize
me
My
fears,
my
hopes
and
dreams
I
just
like
hanging
out
with
you
All
the
time
All
those
times
that
you
did
not
leave
It's
been
occurring
to
me
I
would
like
to
hang
out
with
you
For
my
whole
life
Stay
And
I
will
be
loving
you
for
quite
some
time
No
one
else
is
going
to
love
me
when
I
get
mad,
mad,
mad
So
I
think
that
it
is
best
if
we
both
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay
Stay,
stay,
stay
I
have
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time,
time,
time
You
think
that
it
is
funny
when
I
am
mad,
mad,
mad
But
I
think
that
it
is
best
if
we
both
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay,
stay
Stay,
stay,
stay
I
have
been
loving
you
for
quite
some
time,
time,
time
You
think
that
it
is
funny
when
I
am
mad,
mad,
mad
But
I
think
that
it
is
best
if
we
both
stay
That's
so
fun
