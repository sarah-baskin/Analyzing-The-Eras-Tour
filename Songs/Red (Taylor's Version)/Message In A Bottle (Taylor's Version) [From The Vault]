I
know
that
you
like
me
And
it
is
kind
of
frightenin'
standin'
here
waitin',
waitin'
And
I
became
hypnotized
By
freckles
and
bright
eyes,
tongue-tied
But
now,
you
are
so
far
away
and
I
am
down
Feelin'
like
a
face
in
the
crowd
I
am
reachin'
for
you,
terrified
'Cause
you
could
be
the
one
that
I
love
I
could
be
the
one
that
you
dream
of
A
message
in
a
bottle
is
all
I
can
do
Standin'
here,
hopin'
it
gets
to
you
You
could
be
the
one
that
I
keep,
and
I
I
could
be
the
reason
you
cannot
sleep
at
night
A
message
in
a
bottle
is
all
I
can
do
Standin'
here,
hopin'
it
gets
to
you
These
days
I
am
restless
Workdays
are
endless,
look
how
you
made
me,
made
me
But
time
moves
faster
Replayin'
your
laughter,
disaster
'Cause
now,
you
are
so
far
away
and
I
am
down
Feelin'
like
a
face
in
the
crowd
I
am
reachin'
for
you,
terrified,
because
'Cause
you
could
be
the
one
that
I
love
I
could
be
the
one
that
you
dream
of
A
message
in
a
bottle
is
all
I
can
do
Standin'
here,
hopin'
it
gets
to
you
(It
gets
to
you)
You
could
be
the
one
that
I
keep,
and
I
(Ah)
I
could
be
the
reason
you
cannot
sleep
at
night
(At)
A
message
in
a
bottle
is
all
I
can
do
Standin'
here,
hopin'
it
gets
to
you
How
is
it
in
London?
(London)
Where
were
you
while
I
am
wonderin'
(Wonderin')
If
I
will
ever
see
you
again?
You
could
be
the
one
that
I
love,
mm-mm
And
now
I
am
standin'
here,
hopin'
it
gets
to
you
'Cause
you
could
be
the
one
that
I
love
