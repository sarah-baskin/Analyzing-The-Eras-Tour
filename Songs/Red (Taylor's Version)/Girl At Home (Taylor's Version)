Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that,
ah-ah
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that
I
do
not
even
know
her
But
I
feel
a
responsibility
To
do
what
is
upstanding
and
right
It's
kind
of
like
a
code,
yeah
And
you
have
been
getting
closer
and
closer
And
crossing
so
many
lines
And
it
would
be
a
fine
proposition
If
I
was
a
stupid
girl
But,
honey,
I
am
no
one's
exception
This,
I
have
previously
learned
So
do
not
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that,
ah-ah
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
I
see
you
turn
off
your
phone
And
now
you
have
got
me
alone,
and
I
say
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
I
just
want
to
make
sure
You
understand
perfectly
You're
the
kind
of
man
who
makes
me
sad
While
she
waits
up
You
chase
down
the
newest
thing
And
take
for
granted
what
you
have
And
it
would
be
a
fine
proposition
If
I
was
a
stupid
girl
And,
yeah,
I
might
go
with
it
If
I
had
not
once
been
just
like
her
So
do
not
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that,
ah-ah
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
I
see
you
turn
off
your
phone
And
now
you
have
got
me
alone,
and
I
say
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Call
a
cab,
lose
my
number
You're
about
to
lose
your
girl
Call
a
cab,
lose
my
number
Let's
consider
this
lesson
learned
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that,
ah-ah
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
Wanna
see
you
pick
up
your
phone
And
tell
her
you
are
coming
home
Don't
look
at
me,
you
got
a
girl
at
home
And
everybody
knows
that,
everybody
knows
that
It
would
be
a
fine
proposition
If
I
had
not
once
been
just
like
her
