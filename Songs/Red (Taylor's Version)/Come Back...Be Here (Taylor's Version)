you
said
it
in
a
simple
way
4
am
,
the
second
day
how
strange
that
i
do
n't
know
you
at
all
stumbled
through
the
long
goodbye
one
last
kiss
,
then
catch
your
flight
right
when
i
was
just
about
to
fall
i
told
myself
,
``
do
n't
get
attached
''
but
in
my
mind
,
i
play
it
back
spinning
faster
than
the
plane
that
took
you
and
this
is
when
the
feelin
'
sinks
in
i
do
n't
wan
na
miss
you
like
this

back
,

here

n't
wan
na
need
you
this
way
come
back
,

here

delicate
beginnin
'
rush
the
feelin
'
you
can
know
so
much
without
knowing
anything
at
all
and
now
that
i
can
put
this
down
if
i
had
known
what
i
know
now
i
never
would
've
played
so
nonchalant
taxi
cabs
and
busy
streets
that
never
bring
you
back
to
me
i
ca
n't
help
but
wish
you
took
me
with
you
