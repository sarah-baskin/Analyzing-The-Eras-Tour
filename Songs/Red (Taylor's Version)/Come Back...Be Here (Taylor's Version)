You
said
it
in
a
simple
way
4
AM,
the
second
day
How
strange
that
I
do
not
know
you
at
all
Stumbled
through
the
long
goodbye
One
last
kiss,
then
catch
your
flight
Right
when
I
was
just
about
to
fall
I
told
myself,
"Don't
get
attached"
But
in
my
mind,
I
play
it
back
Spinning
faster
than
the
plane
that
took
you
And
this
is
when
the
feelin'
sinks
in
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
like
this
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
I
guess
you
are
in
New
York
today
I
do
not
want
to
need
you
this
way
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
The
delicate
beginnin'
rush
The
feelin'
you
can
know
so
much
Without
knowing
anything
at
all
And
now
that
I
can
put
this
down
If
I
had
known
what
I
know
now
I
never
would
have
played
so
nonchalant
Taxi
cabs
and
busy
streets
That
never
bring
you
back
to
me
I
cannot
help
but
wish
you
took
me
with
you
And
this
is
when
the
feelin'
sinks
in
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
like
this
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
I
guess
you
are
in
London
today
And
I
do
not
want
to
need
you
this
way
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
Oh,
oh
Oh,
oh
Oh,
oh
This
is
falling
in
love
in
the
cruelest
way
This
is
fallin'
for
you
when
you
are
worlds
away
In
New
York,
be
here
But
you
are
in
London
and
I
break
down
'Cause
it
is
not
fair
that
you
are
not
around
This
is
when
the
feelin'
sinks
in
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
like
this
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
I
guess
you
are
in
New
York
today
And
I
do
not
want
to
need
you
this
way
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
Oh,
oh
I
do
not
want
to
miss
you
like
this
Oh,
oh
Come
back,
be
here
Come
back,
be
here
