It
feels
like
a
perfect
night
To
dress
up
like
hipsters
And
make
fun
of
our
exes
Uh-uh,
uh-uh
It
feels
like
a
perfect
night
For
breakfast
at
midnight
To
fall
in
love
with
strangers
Uh-uh,
uh-uh
Yeah
We're
happy,
free,
confused,
and
lonely
at
the
same
time
It's
miserable
and
magical,
oh
yeah
Tonight's
the
night
when
we
forget
about
the
deadlines
It's
time,
oh-oh
I
do
not
know
about
you
But
I
am
feelin'
twenty-two
Everything
will
be
alright
if
You
keep
me
next
to
you
You
do
not
know
about
me
But
I
will
bet
you
want
to
Everything
will
be
alright
if
We
just
keep
dancin'
like
we
are
Twenty-two
Twenty-two
It
seems
like
one
of
those
nights
This
place
is
too
crowded
Too
many
cool
kids
Uh-uh,
uh-uh
(Who's
Taylor
Swift
anyway?
Ew)
It
seems
like
one
of
those
nights
We
ditch
the
whole
scene
And
end
up
dreamin'
Instead
of
sleepin'
Yeah
We're
happy,
free,
confused,
and
lonely
in
the
best
way
It's
miserable
and
magical,
oh,
yeah
Tonight's
the
night
when
we
forget
about
the
heartbreaks
It's
time,
oh-oh
(Hey)
I
do
not
know
about
you
But
I
am
feelin'

Everything
will
be

about
you)

nights
We
will
not
be
