One,
two,
three,
four
Give
me
the
keys,
I
will
bring
the
car
back
around
We
should
not
be
in
this
town
And
my
so-called
friends,
they
do
not
know
I
would
drive
away
before
I
let
you
go
So
give
me
a
reason
and
do
not
say
no,
no
There's
a
chain
'round
your
throat,
piece
of
paper
where
I
wrote
"I'll
wait
for
you"
There's
a
key
on
the
chain,
there
is
a
picture
in
a
frame
Take
it
with
you
And
run
like
you
would
run
from
the
law
Darling,
let
us
run
Run
from
it
all
We
can
go
where
our
eyes
can
take
us
Go
where
no
one
else
is,
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
So
you
laugh
like
a
child
And
I
will
sing
like
no
one
cares
No
one
to
be
and
no
one
to
tell
I
could
see
this
view
a
hundred
times
Pale
blue
sky
reflected
in
your
eyes
So
give
me
a
reason
and
do
not
say
no,
no
And
the
note
from
the
locket,
you
keep
it
in
your
pocket
Since
I
gave
it
to
you
There's
a
heart
on
your
sleeve,
I
will
take
it
when
I
leave
And
hold
it
for
you
And
run
like
you
would
run
from
the
law
Darling,
let
us
run
Run
from
it
all
We
can
go
like
they
are
trying
to
chase
us
Go
where
no
one
else
is,
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
There's
been
this
hole
in
my
heart
This
thing
was
a
shot
in
the
dark
Say
you
will
never
let
them
tear
us
apart
And
I
will
hold
onto
you
while
we
run
(And
we
run
and
we
run
and
we
run)
Like
you
would
run
from
the
law
(And
we
run
and
we
run
and
we
run)
Darling,
let
us
run
(And
we
run
and
we
run
and
we
run)
Run
from
it
all
(And
we
run
and
we
run
and
we
run)
We
can
go
where
our
eyes
can
take
us
Go
where
no
one
else
is,
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
we
will
run
Ooh,
and
we
will
run
