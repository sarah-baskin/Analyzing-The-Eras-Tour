What
about
your
promises,
promises?
What
about
your
promises,
promises,
promises?
No
What
a
shame
Didn't
want
to
be
the
one
that
got
away,
yeah
Big
mistake,
you
broke
the
sweetest
promise
That
you
never
should
have
made
I
am
here
on
the
kitchen
floor
You
call,
but
I
will
not
hear
it
You
said,
"No
one
else"
How
could
you
do
this,
babe?
(What
about
your
promises,
promises?)
You
really
blew
this,
babe
We
are
not
getting
through
this
one,
babe
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you,
babe
(This
is
the
last
time,
this
is
the
last
time)
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you,
babe
(What
about
your
promises,
promises,
promises?
No)
What
a
waste
Takin'
down
the
pictures
and
the
plans
we
made,
yeah
And
it
is
strange
how
your
face
does
not
look
so
innocent
Your
secret
has
its
consequence
and
that
is
on
you,
babe
I
break
down
every
time
you
call
We're
a
wreck,
you
are
the
wrecking
ball
We
said,
"No
one
else"
How
could
you
do
this,
babe?
(Oh,
what
about
your
promises,
promises?)
You
really
blew
this,
babe
We
are
not
getting
through
this
one,
babe
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you,
babe
(This
is
the
last
time,
this
is
the
last
time)
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you
Since
you
admitted
it
(Oh-oh),
I
keep
picturin'
(Oh-oh)
Her
lips
on
your
neck
(Oh-oh),
I
cannot
unsee
it
I
hate
that
because
of
you,
I
cannot
love
you,
babe
What
a
shame,
did
not
want
to
be
the
one
that
got
away
How
could
you
do
this,
babe?
(Babe)
You
really
blew
this,
babe
(Babe)
We
are
not
getting
through
this
one,
babe
(Babe)
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you,
babe
(Babe)
(This
is
the
last
time,
this
is
the
last
time)
This
is
the
last
time
I
will
ever
call
you
I
am
here
on
the
kitchen
floor
You

but
I
will
