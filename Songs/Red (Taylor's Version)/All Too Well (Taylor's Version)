i
walked
through
the
door
with
you
,
the
air
was
cold
but
something
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
and
i
left
my
scarf
there
at
your
sister
's
house
and
you
've
still
got
it
in
your
drawer
,
even
now
oh
,
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we
're
singing
in
the
car
,
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
falling
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days
and
i
know
it
's
long
gone
and
that
magic
's
not
here
no
more
and
i
might
be
okay
,
but
i
'm
not
fine
at
all
oh
,
oh
,
oh
'cause
there
we
are
again
on
that
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
the
red
'cause
you
were
lookin
'
over
at
me
wind
in
my
hair
,
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
photo
album
on
the
counter
,
your
cheeks
were
turning
red
you
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin-sized
bed
and
your
mother
's
telling
stories
'bout
you
on
the
tee-ball
team
you
taught
me
'bout
your
past
,
thinking
your
future
was
me
and
i
know
it
's
long
gone
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
and
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
to
forget
why
i
needed
to
'cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
're
dancing
'round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
down
the
stairs
,
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
,
yeah
and
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
all
up
running
scared
,
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
being
honest
i
'm
a
crumpled
up
piece
of
paper
lying
here
'cause
i
remember
it
all
,
all
,
all
too
well
time
wo
n't
fly
,
it
's
like
i
'm
paralyzed
by
it
i
'd
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
,
but
i
'm
still
trying
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
'cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
ca
n't
get
rid
of
it
'cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
,
yeah
'cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real
thing
you
've
ever
known
it
was
rare
,
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
wind
in
my
hair
,
you
were
there
you
remember
it
all
down
the
stairs
,
you
were
there
you
remember
it
all
it
was
rare
,
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
