loving
him
is
like
driving
a
new
maserati
down
a
dead-end
street
faster
than
the
wind
,
passionate
as
sin
,
ending
so
suddenly
loving
him
is
like
trying
to
change
your
mind
once
you
're
already
flying
through
the
free
fall
like
the
colors
in
autumn
,
so
bright
just
before
they
lose
it
all
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
'd
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
gray
,
all
alone
(
woah
)
forgetting
him
was
like
tryin
'
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red
(
red
,
red
)
(
red
,
red
)
but
loving
him
was
red
(
red
,
red
)
(
red
,
red
)
touching
him
was
like
realizing
all
you
ever
wanted
was
right
there
in
front
of
you
memorizing
him
was
as
easy
as
knowing
all
the
words
to
your
old
favorite
song
fighting
with
him
was
like
trying
to
solve
a
crossword
and
realizing
there
's
no
right
answer
regretting
him
was
like
wishing
you
never
found
out
that
love
could
be
that
strong
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
'd
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
gray
,
all
alone
(
woah
)
forgetting
him
was
like
tryin
'
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red
(
red

red
)
oh
,
red
(
red
,
red
)
burning
red
(
red
,
red
)
(
red
,

)
remembering
him
comes
in
flashbacks
and
echoes
tell
myself
it
's
time
now
,
got
ta
let
go
but
moving
on
from
him
is
impossible
when
i
still
see
it
all
in
my
head
in
burning
red
burning
,
it
was
red
oh

losing
him
was
