He
says
he
does
not
believe
anything
much
he
hears
these
days
He
says,
"Why
fall
in
love,
just
so
you
can
watch
it
go
away?"
He
spends
most
of
his
nights
wishing
it
was
how
it
used
to
be
He
spends
most
of
his
flights
getting
pulled
down
by
gravity
I
call,
just
checkin'
up
on
him
He's
up,
3AM,
pacin'
He
says,
"It's
not
just
a
phase
I
am
in"
My
voice
comes
out
beggin'
All
this
time,
I
did
not
know
You
were
breakin'
down
I
would
fall
to
pieces
on
the
floor
If
you
were
not
around
Too
young
to
know
it
gets
better
I
will
be
summer
sun
for
you
forever
Forever
winter
if
you
go
He
seems
fine
most
of
the
time,
forcing
smiles
and
never
minds
His
laugh
is
a
symphony,
when
the
lights
go
out,
it
is
hard
to
breathe
I
pull
at
every
thread
trying
to
solve
the
puzzles
in
his
head
Live
my
life
scared
to
death
he
will
decide
to
leave
instead
I
call,
just
checkin'
up
on
him
He's
up,
5AM,
wasted
Long
gone,
not
even
listening
My
voice
comes
out
screamin'
All
this
time,
I
did
not
know
You
were
breakin'
down
I
would
fall
to
pieces
on
the
floor
If
you
were
not
around
Too
young
to
know
it
gets
better
I
will
be
summer
sun
for
you
forever
Forever
winter
if
you
go
If
I
was
standing
there
in
your
apartment
I
would
take
that
bomb
in
your
head
and
disarm
it
I
would
say,
"I
love
you
even
at
your
darkest
and
Please,
do
not
go"
I
did
not
know
You
were
breakin'
down
I
would
fall
to
pieces
on
the
floor
If
you
were
not
around
Too
young
to
know
it
gets
better
I
will
be
summer
sun
for
you
forever
Forever
winter
if
you
go
(Ooh,
ooh,
ooh)
I
will
be
your
summer
sun
forever
(Ooh,
ooh,
ooh)
At
3AM,
pacin'
All
this
time,
I
did
not
know
(Ooh,
ooh,
ooh)
At
5AM,
wasted
I
would
be
in
pieces
on
the
floor
Forever
winter
if
you
go
He
says
he
does
not
believe
anything
much
he
hears
these
days
I
say,
"Believe
in
one
thing,
I
will
not
go
away"
