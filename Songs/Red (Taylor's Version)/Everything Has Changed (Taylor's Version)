You

Know

I
did
not

And

since
eighteen
hours

Is
green
eyes
and
freckles
and
your
smile
In
the

of
my
mind

you
better

you
Know

'Cause
all
I
know
is
we
said,
"Hello"
And
your
eyes
look
like
comin'
home
All
I
know
is
a
simple
name
Everything
has
changed
All
I
know
is

held
the
door
You'll

will
be

All
I

walls
stood
tall,
painted
blue
But

will
take
them
down,

them
down
And
open
up
the
door
for
you
And
all
I
feel
in
my
stomach
is
butterflies
The
beautiful
kind,
makin'
up
for
lost
time
Takin'
flight,
makin'

you
better
