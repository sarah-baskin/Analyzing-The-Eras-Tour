Put
your
lips
close
to
mine
As
long
as
they
do
not
touch
Out
of
focus,
eye
to
eye
'Til
the
gravity's
too
much
And
I
will
do
anything
you
say
If
you
say
it
with
your
hands
And
I
would
be
smart
to
walk
away
But
you
are
quicksand
This
slope
is
treacherous
This
path
is
reckless
This
slope
is
treacherous
And
I-I-I
like
it
I
cannot
decide
if
it
is
a
choice
Getting
swept
away
I
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
Asking
you
to
stay
All
we
are
is
skin
and
bone
Trained
to
get
along
Forever
going
with
the
flow
But
you
are
friction
This
slope
is
treacherous
This
path
is
reckless
This
slope
is
treacherous
I-I-I
like
it
Two
headlights
shine
through
the
sleepless
night
And
I
will
get
you
a
-
get
you
alone
Your
name
has
echoed
through
my
mind
And
I
just
think
you
should
-
think
you
should
know
That
nothing
safe
is
worth
the
drive
And
I
would
follow
you,
follow
you
home
I
will
follow
you,
follow
you
home
This
hope
is
treacherous
This
daydream
is
dangerous
This
hope
is
treacherous
I-I-I,
I-I-I,
I-I-I
-
Two
headlights
shine
through
the
sleepless
night
And
I
will
get
you
a
-
get
you
alone
Your
name
has
echoed
through
my
mind
And
I
just
think
you
should
-
think
you
should
know
That
nothing
safe
is
worth
the
drive
And
I
will
follow
you,
follow
you
home
I
will
follow
you,
follow
you
home
I
will
follow
you,
follow
you
home
I
will
follow
you,
follow
you
home
This
slope
is
treacherous
I-I-I
like
it
