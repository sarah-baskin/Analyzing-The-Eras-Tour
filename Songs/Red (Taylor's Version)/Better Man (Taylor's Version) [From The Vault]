I
know
I
am
probably
better
off
on
my
own
Than
lovin'
a
man
who
did
not
know
what
he
had
when
he
had
it
And
I
see
the
permanent
damage
you
did
to
me
Never
again,
I
just
wish
I
could
forget
when
it
was
magic
I
wish
it
was
not
4AM,
standin'
in
the
mirror
Saying
to
myself,
"You
know
you
had
to
do
it"
I
know
the
bravest
thing
I
ever
did
was
run
Sometimes,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
I
can
feel
you
again
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
I
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
A
better
man
I
know
I
am
probably
better
off
all
alone
Than
needing
a
man
who
could
change
his
mind
at
any
given
minute
And
it
was
always
on
your
terms,
I
waited
on
every
careless
word
Hoping
they
might
turn
sweet
again
like
it
was
in
the
beginning
But
your
jealousy,
oh,
I
can
hear
it
now
Talking
down
to
me
like
I
would
always
be
around
Push
my
love
away
like
it
was
some
kind
of
loaded
gun
Oh,
you
never
thought
I
would
run
Sometimes,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
I
can
feel
you
again
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
I
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
A
better
man
I
hold
onto
this
pride
because,
these
days,
it
is
all
I
have
And
I
gave
to
you
my
best
And
we
both
know
you
cannot
say
that
I
wish
you
were
a
better
man
I
wonder
what
we
would
have
become
if
you
were
a
better
man
We
might
still
be
in
love
if
you
were
a
better
man
You
would
have
been
the
one
if
you
were
a
better
man
Sometimes,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
I
can
feel
you
again
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
I
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
A
better
man
(Sometimes,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
I
can
feel
you
again)
We
might
still
be
in
love,
if
you
were
a
better
man
(But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man)
I
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
But
I
just
miss
you
and
I
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
A
better
man
We
might
still
be
in
love
if
you
were
a
better
man
You
would
have
been
the
one
if
you
were
a
better
man
