i
know
i
'm
probably
better
off
on
my
own
than
lovin
'
a
man
who
did
n't
know
what
he
had
when
he
had
it
and
i
see
the
permanent
damage
you
did
to
me
never
again
,
i
just
wish
i
could
forget
when
it
was
magic
i
wish
it
was
n't
4am
,
standin
'
in
the
mirror
saying
to
myself
,
``
you
know
you
had
to
do
it
''
i
know
the
bravest
thing
i
ever
did
was
run
sometimes
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
i
can
feel
you
again
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
i
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
a
better
man
i
know
i
'm
probably
better
off
all
alone
than
needing
a
man
who
could
change
his
mind
at
any
given
minute
and
it
was
always
on
your
terms
,
i
waited
on
every
careless
word
hoping
they
might
turn
sweet
again
like
it
was
in
the
beginning
but
your
jealousy
,
oh
,
i
can
hear
it
now
talking
down
to
me
like
i
'd
always
be
around
push
my
love
away
like
it
was
some
kind
of
loaded
gun
oh
,
you
never
thought
i
'd
run
sometimes
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
i
can
feel
you
again
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
i
know
why
we
had
to
say
goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
a
better
man
i
hold
onto
this
pride
because
,
these
days
,
it
's
all
i
have
and
i
gave
to
you
my
best
and
we
both
know
you
ca
n't
say
that
i
wish
you
were
a
better
man
i
wonder
what
we
would
've
become
if
you
were
a
better
man
we
might
still
be
in
love
if
you
were
a
better
man
you
would
've
been
the
one
if
you
were
a
better
man
sometimes
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
i
can
feel
you
again
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just

were
a
better

i
know
why
we
had
to

goodbye
like
the
back
of
my
hand
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
wish
you
were
a
better
man
a
better
man
(
sometimes
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
i
can
feel
you
again
)
we
might
still
be
in
love
,
if
you
were
a
better
man
(
but
i
just
miss
you
and
i
just
