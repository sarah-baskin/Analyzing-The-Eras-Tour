One
night,
a
few
moons
ago
I
saw
flecks
of
what
could
have
been
lights
But
it
might
just
have
been
you
Passing
by
unbeknownst
to
me
Life
is
emotionally
abusive
And
time
cannot
stop
me
quite
like
you
did
And
my
flight
was
awful,
thanks
for
asking
I
am
unglued,
thanks
to
you
And
it
is
like
snow
at
the
beach
Weird,
but
fuckin'
beautiful
Flying
in
a
dream
Stars
by
the
pocketful
You
wanting
me
Tonight
feels
impossible
But
it
is
comin'
down
No
sound,
it
is
all
around
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow,
ah
This
scene
feels
like
what
I
once
saw
on
a
screen
I
searched
"aurora
borealis
green"
I
have
never
seen
someone
lit
from
within
Blurring
out
my
periphery
My
smile
is
like
I
won
a
contest
And
to
hide
that
would
be
so
dishonest
And
it
is
fine
to
fake
it
'til
you
make
it
'Til
you
do,
'til
it
is
true
Now
it
is
like
snow
at
the
beach
Weird,
but
fuckin'
beautiful
Flying
in
a
dream
Stars
by
the
pocketful
You
wanting
me
Tonight
feels
impossible
But
it
is
comin'
down
No
sound,
it
is
all
around
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow,
ah
I
(I)
cannot
(Can't)
speak,
afraid
to
jinx
it
I
(I)
do
not
(Don't)
even
dare
to
wish
it
But
your
eyes
are
flying
saucers
from
another
planet
Now
I
am
all
for
you
like
Janet
Can
this
be
a
real
thing?
Can
it?
Are
we
falling
like
snow
at
the
beach?
(Snow
at
the
beach)
Weird,
but
fuckin'
beautiful
Flying
in
a
dream
(Flying
in
a
dream)
Stars
by
the
pocketful
You
wanting
me
(You
wanting
me)
Tonight
feels
impossible
But
it
is
comin'
down
No
sound,
it
is
all
around
Like
snow
on
the
beach
(Snow
on
the
beach)
Like
snow
on
the
beach
(Flying
in
a
dream)
Like
snow
on
the
beach
(You
wanting
me)
Like
snow,
ah
But
it
is
comin'
down
No
sound,
it
is
all
around
Like
snow
on
the
beach
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
Like
snow
on
the
beach
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
(It's
comin'
down,
it
is
comin'
down)
