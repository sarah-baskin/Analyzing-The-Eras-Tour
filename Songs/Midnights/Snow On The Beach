one
night
,
a
few
moons
ago
i
saw
flecks
of
what
could
've
been
lights
but
it
might
just
have
been
you
passing
by
unbeknownst
to
me
life
is
emotionally
abusive
and
time
ca
n't
stop
me
quite
like
you
did
and
my
flight
was
awful
,
thanks
for
asking
i
'm
unglued
,
thanks
to
you
taylor
swift
,
taylor
swift
&
lana
del
and
it
's
like
snow
at
the
beach
weird
,
but
fuckin
'
beautiful
flying
in
a
dream
stars
by
the
pocketful
you
wanting
me
tonight
feels
impossible
but
it
's
comin
'
down
no
sound
,
it
's
all
around
taylor
swift
,
lana
del
like
snow
on
the
beach
like
snow
on
the
beach
like
snow
on
the
beach
like
snow

this
scene
feels
like
what
i
once
saw
on
a
screen
i
searched
``
aurora
borealis
green
''
i
've
never
seen
someone
lit
from
within
blurring
out
my
periphery
my
smile
is
like
i
won
a
contest
and
to
hide
that
would
be
so
dishonest
and
it
's
fine
to
fake
it
'til
you
make
it
'til
you
do
,
'til
it
's
true
taylor
swift
&
lana

it
's
like
snow
at
the
beach

,
but
fuckin
'
beautiful

in

dream

pocketful
you
wanting

feels
