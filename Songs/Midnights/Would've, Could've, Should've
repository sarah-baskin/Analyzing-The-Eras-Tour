if
you
would
've
blinked
,
then
i
would
've
looked
away
at
the
first
glance
if
you
tasted
poison
,
you
could
've
spit
me
out
at
the
first
chance
and
if
i
was
some
paint
,
did
it
splatter
on
a
promising
grown
man
?
and
if
i
was
a
child
,
did
it
matter
if
you
got
to
wash
your
hands
?
ooh
,
all
i
used
to
do
was
pray
would
've
,
could
've
,
should
've
if
you
'd
never
looked
my
way
i
would
've
stayed
on
my
knees
and
i
damn
sure
never
would
've
danced
with
the
devil
at
nineteen
and
the
god
's
honest
truth
is
that
the
pain
was
heaven
and
now
that
i
'm
grown
,
i
'm
scared
of
ghosts
memories
feel
like
weapons
and
now
that
i
know
,
i
wish
you
'd
left
me
wondering
if
you
never
touched
me
,
i
would
've
gone
along
with
the
righteous
if
i
never
blushed
,
then
they
could
've
never
whispered
about
this
and
if
you
never
saved
me
from
boredom
i
could
've
gone
on
as
i
was
but
,
lord
,
you
made
me
feel
important
and
then
you
tried
to
erase
us
ooh
,
you
're
a
crisis
of
my
faith
would
've
,
could
've
,
should
've
if
i
'd
only
played
it
safe
i
would
've
stayed
on
my
knees
and
i
damn
sure
never
would
've
danced
with
the
devil
at
nineteen

who
i
used
