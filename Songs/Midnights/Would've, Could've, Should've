If
you
would
have
blinked,
then
I
would
have
Looked
away
at
the
first
glance
If
you
tasted
poison,
you
could
have
Spit
me
out
at
the
first
chance
And
if
I
was
some
paint,
did
it
splatter
On
a
promising
grown
man?
And
if
I
was
a
child,
did
it
matter
If
you
got
to
wash
your
hands?
Ooh,
all
I
used
to
do
was
pray
Would've,
could've,
should
have
If
you
would
never
looked
my
way
I
would
have
stayed
on
my
knees
And
I
damn
sure
never
would
have
danced
with
the
devil
At
nineteen
And
the
God's
honest
truth
is
that
the
pain
was
heaven
And
now
that
I
am
grown,
I
am
scared
of
ghosts
Memories
feel
like
weapons
And
now
that
I
know,
I
wish
you
would
left
me
wondering
If
you
never
touched
me,
I
would
have
Gone
along
with
the
righteous
If
I
never
blushed,
then
they
could
have
Never
whispered
about
this
And
if
you
never
saved
me
from
boredom
I
could
have
gone
on
as
I
was
But,
Lord,
you
made
me
feel
important
And
then
you
tried
to
erase
us
Ooh,
you
are
a
crisis
of
my
faith
Would've,
could've,
should
have
If
I
would
only
played
it
safe
I
would
have
stayed
on
my
knees
And
I
damn
sure
never
would
have
danced
with
the
devil
At
nineteen
And
the
God's
honest
truth
is
that
the
pain
was
heaven
And
now
that
I
am
grown,
I
am
scared
of
ghosts
Memories
feel
like
weapons
And
now
that
I
know,
I
wish
you
would
left
me
wondering
God
rest
my
soul
I
miss
who
I
used
to
be
The
tomb
will
not
close
Stained
glass
windows
in
my
mind
I
regret
you
all
the
time
I
cannot
let
this
go
I
fight
with
you
in
my
sleep
The
wound
will
not
close
I
keep
on
waiting
for
a
sign
I
regret
you
all
the
time
If
clarity's
in
death,
then
why
will
not
this
die?
Years
of
tearing
down
our
banners,
you
and
I
Living
for
the
thrill
of
hitting
you
where
it
hurts
Give
me
back
my
girlhood,
it
was
mine
first
And
I
damn
sure
never
would
have
danced
with
the
devil
At
nineteen
And
the
God's
honest
truth
is
that
the
pain
was

And

that
I
am

I
am

will

I

you
all

Oh,
God
rest
