Baby
love,
I
think
I
have
been
a
little
too
kind
Didn't
notice
you
walkin'
all
over
my
peace
of
mind
In
the
shoes
I
gave
you
as
a
present
Puttin'
someone
first
only
works
when
you
are
in
their
top
five
And
by
the
way,
I
am
goin'
out
tonight
Best
believe
I
am
still
bejeweled
When
I
walk
in
the
room
I
can
still
make
the
whole
place
shimmer
And
when
I
meet
the
band
They
ask,
"Do
you
have
a
man?"
I
could
still
say,
"I
do
not
remember"
Familiarity
breeds
contempt
Don't
put
me
in
the
basement
When
I
want
the
penthouse
of
your
heart
Diamonds
in
my
eyes
I
polish
up
real,
I
polish
up
real
nice
Nice
Baby
boy,
I
think
I
have
been
too
good
of
a
girl
(Too
good
of
a
girl)
Did
all
the
extra
credit,
then
got
graded
on
a
curve
I
think
it
is
time
to
teach
some
lessons
I
made
you
my
world
(Huh),
have
you
heard?
(Huh)
I
can
reclaim
the
land
And
I
miss
you
(Miss
you),
but
I
miss
sparklin'
(Nice)
Best
believe
I
am
still
bejeweled
When
I
walk
in
the
room
I
can
still
make
the
whole
place
shimmer
And
when
I
meet
the

They
ask,
"Do
you
have

could
still

do

Diamonds

I
polish
up
real,
I
polish
up
real
nice
Nice
Sapphire
tears
on
my
face
Sadness
became
my
whole
sky
But
some
guy
said
my
aura's
moonstone
Just
because
he
was
high
And
we
are
dancin'
all
night
And
you
can
try
to
change
my
mind
But
you
might
have
to
wait
in
line
What's
a
girl
going
to
do?
A
diamond's
got
to
shine
Best
believe
I
am
still
bejeweled
When
I
walk
in
the
room
I
can
still
make
the
whole
place
shimmer
(Shimmer)
And
when
I
meet
the
band
They
ask,
"Do
you
have
a
man?"
I
could
still
say,
"I
do
not
