Lock
broken,
slur
spoken
Wound
open,
game
token
I
did
not
know
you
were
keeping
count
Rain
soaking,
blind
hoping
You
said
I
was
freeloading
I
did
not
know
you
were
keeping
count
High
infidelity
Put
on
your
records
and
regret
me
I
bent
the
truth
too
far
tonight
I
was
dancing
around,
dancing
around
it
High
infidelity
Put
on
your
headphones
and
burn
my
city
Your
picket
fence
is
sharp
as
knives
I
was
dancing
around,
dancing
around
it
Do
you
really
want
to
know
where
I
was
April
29th?
Do
I
really
have
to
chart
the
constellations
in
his
eyes?
Storm
coming,
good
husband
Bad
omen
Dragged
my
feet
right
down
the
aisle
At
the
house
lonely,
good
money
I
would
pay
if
you
would
just
know
me
Seemed
like
the
right
thing
at
the
time
You
know
there
is
many
different
ways
that
you
can
kill
the
one
you
love
The
slowest
way
is
never
loving
them
enough
Do
you
really
want
to
know
where
I
was
April
29th?
Do
I
really
have
to
tell
you
how
he
brought
me
back
to
life?
High
infidelity
Put
on
your
records
and
regret
me
I
bent
the
truth
too

I

around
it
High
infidelity
Put
on
your
headphones
and

Your

is

I

Your

I

it
Oh,
there
is
many
different
ways
that
you
can
kill
the
one
you
love
And
it
is
never
enough,
it
is
never
enough
