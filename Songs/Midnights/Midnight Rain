rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
,
i
wanted
that
pain
he
wanted
a
bride
,
i
was
making
my
own
name
chasing
that
fame
,
he
stayed
the
same
all
of
me
changed
like
midnight
my
town
was
a
wasteland
full
of
cages
,
full
of
fences
pageant
queens
and
big
pretenders
but
for
some
,
it
was
paradise
my
boy
was
a
montage
a
slow-motion
,
love
potion
jumping
off
things
in
the
ocean
i
broke
his
heart
'cause
he
was
nice
he
was
sunshine
,
i
was
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
,
i
wanted
that
pain
he
wanted
a
bride
,
i
was
making
my
own
name
chasing
that
fame
,
he
stayed
the
same
all
of
me
changed
like
midnight
it
came
like
a
postcard
picture
perfect
shiny
family
holiday
peppermint
candy
but
for
him
,
it
's
every
day
so
i
peered
through
a
window
a
deep
portal
,
time
travel
all
the
love
we
unravel
and
the
life
i
gave
away
'cause
he
was
sunshine
,
i
was
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
,
i
wanted
that
pain
he
wanted
a
bride
,
i
was
making
my
own
name
chasing
that
fame
,
he
stayed
the
same
all
of
me
changed
like
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
,
i
wanted
that
pain
he
wanted
a
bride
,
i
was
making
my
own
name
chasing
that
fame
,
he
stayed
the
same
all
of
me
changed
like
midnight
i
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
just
what
we
wanted
,
just
what
we
wanted
and
he
never
thinks
of
me
except
for
when
i
'm
on
tv
i
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
some
kind
of
haunted
,
some
kind
of
haunted
and
i
never
think
of
him
except
on
midnights
like
this
(
midnights
like
this
,
midnights
