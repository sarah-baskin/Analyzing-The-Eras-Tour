We
were
supposed
to
be
just
friends
You
do
not
live
in
my
part
of
town,
but
maybe
I
will
see
you
out
some
weekend
Depending
on
what
kind
of
mood
and
situationship
I
am
in
And
what
is
in
my
system
I
think
there
is
been
a
glitch,
oh,
yeah
Five
seconds
later,
I
am
fastening
myself
to
you
with
a
stitch,
oh,
yeah
And
I
am
not
even
sorry,
nights
are
so
starry
Blood
moonlit
It
must
be
counterfeit
I
think
there
is
been
a
glitch,
oh,
yeah
I
was
supposed
to
sweat
you
out
In
search
of
glorious
happenings
of
happenstance
on
someone
else's
playground
But
it
is
been
two-thousand
one-hundred
ninety
days
of
our
love
blackout
(Our
love
is
blacking
out)
The
system's
breaking
down
(The
system's
breaking
down)
I
think
there
is
been
a
glitch,
oh,
yeah
Five
seconds
later,
I
am
fastening
myself
to
you
with
a
stitch,
oh,
yeah
And
I
am
not
even
sorry,
nights
are
so
starry
Blood
moonlit
It
must
be
counterfeit
I
think
there
is
been
a
glitch
A
brief
interruption,
a
slight
malfunction
I
would
go
back
to
wanting
dudes
who
give
nothing
I
thought
we
had
no
chance
And
that
is
romance,
let
us
dance
Glitch,
oh,
yeah
Five

I

to
you
with
