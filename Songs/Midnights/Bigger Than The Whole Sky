No
words
appear
before
me
in
the
aftermath
Salt
streams
out
my
eyes
and
into
my
ears
Every
single
thing
I
touch
becomes
sick
with
sadness
'Cause
it
is
all
over
now,
all
out
to
sea
Goodbye,
goodbye,
goodbye
You
were
bigger
than
the
whole
sky
You
were
more
than
just
a
short
time
And
I
have
got
a
lot
to
pine
about
I
have
got
a
lot
to
live
without
I
am
never
going
to
meet
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
What
should
have
been
you
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
you
Did
some
bird
flap
its
wings
over
in
Asia?
Did
some
force
take
you
because
I
did
not
pray?
Every
single
thing
to
come
has
turned
into
ashes
'Cause
it
is
all
over,
it
is
not
meant
to
be
So
I
will
say
words
I
do
not
believe
Goodbye,
goodbye,
goodbye
You
were
bigger
than
the
whole
sky
You
were
more
than
just
a
short
time
And
I
have
got
a
lot
to
pine
about
I
have
got
a
lot
to
live
without
I
am
never
going
to
meet
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
What
should
have
been
you
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
you
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
What
should
have
been
you
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
you
(What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
you)
Goodbye,
goodbye,
goodbye
You
were
bigger
than
the
whole
sky
You
were
more
than
just
a
short
time
And
I
have
got
a
lot
to
pine
about
I
have
got
a
lot
to
live
without
I
am
never
going
to
meet
What
could
have
been,
would
have
been
What
should
have
been
you
