no
words
appear
before
me
in
the
aftermath
salt
streams
out
my
eyes
and
into
my
ears
every
single
thing
i
touch
becomes
sick
with
sadness
'cause
it
's
all
over
now
,
all
out
to
sea
goodbye
,
goodbye
,
goodbye
you
were
bigger
than
the
whole
sky
you
were
more
than
just
a
short
time
and
i
've
got
a
lot
to
pine
about
i
've
got
a
lot
to
live
without
i
'm
never
gon
na
meet
what
could
've
been
,
would
've
been
what
should
've
been
you
what
could
've
been
,
would
've
been
you
did
some
bird
flap
its
wings
over
in
asia
?
did
some
force
take
you
because
i
did
n't
pray
?
every
single
thing
to
come
has
turned
into
ashes
'cause
it
's
all
over
,
it
's
not
meant
to
be
so
i
'll
say
words
i
do
n't
believe
goodbye
,
goodbye
,
goodbye
you
were
bigger
than
the
whole
sky
you
were
more
than
just
a
short
time
and
i
've
got
a
lot
to
pine
about
i
've
got
a
lot
to
live
without
i
'm
never
gon
na
meet
what
could
've
been

've
been
what
should
've
been
you
what
could
've
been
