washed
my
hands
of
us
at
the
club
you
made
a
mess
of
me
i
pictured
you
with
other
girls
in
love
then
threw
up
on
the
street
like
waiting
for
a
bus
that
never
shows
you
just
start
walkin
'
on
they
say
that
if
it
's
right
,
you
know
each
bar
plays
our
song
nothing
has
ever
felt
so
wrong
oh

,
love
is
a
lie

friends
say
to
get
me
by
it

'cause
it
's
you
(
'cause
it
's
you
)
i
used
to
switch
out
these
kens
,
i
'd
just
ghost
rip
the
band-aid
off
and
skip
town
like
an
asshole
outlaw
freedom
felt
like
summer
then
on
the
coast
now
the
sun
burns
my
heart
and
the
sand
hurts
my
feelings
and
i
never
do
n't
cry
(
and
i
never
do
n't
cry
)
at
the
bar

sadness
is
contagious

the
space
that
i
needed

trace
the
evidence
,
make
it
make
some
sense
why
the
wound
is
still
bleedin
'
you
were
the
one
that
i
loved
do
n't
need
another
metaphor
,
it
's
simple
enough
a
wrinkle
in
time
like
the
crease
by
your
eyes
this
is
why
they
should
n't
kill
off
the
main
guy
dreams
of
your
hair
and
your
stare
and
sense
of
belief
in
the
good
in
the
world
,
you
once
believed
in
me
and
i
felt
you
and
i
held
you
for
a
while
bet
i
could
still
melt
your
world
argumentative
,
antithetical
dream
girl
i
heard
your
key
turn
in
the
door
down
the
hallway

that
your
key
in
the
door
?

to
take
me
away
