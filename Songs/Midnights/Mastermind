Once
upon
a
time,
the
planets
and
the
fates
And
all
the
stars
aligned
You
and
I
ended
up
in
the
same
room
At
the
same
time
And
the
touch
of
a
hand
lit
the
fuse
Of
a
chain
reaction
of
countermoves
To
assess
the
equation
of
you
Checkmate,
I
could
not
lose
What
if
I
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental?
And
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
Nothing
was
going
to
stop
me
I
laid
the
groundwork,
and
then
Just
like
clockwork
The
dominoes
cascaded
in
a
line
What
if
I
told
you
I
am
a
mastermind?
And
now
you
are
mine
It
was
all
by
design
'Cause
I
am
a
mastermind
You
see,
all
the
wisest
women
Had
to
do
it
this
way
'Cause
we
were
born
to
be
the
pawn
In
every
lover's
game
If
you
fail
to
plan,
you
plan
to
fail
Strategy
sets
the
scene
for
the
tale
I
am
the
wind
in
our
free-flowing
sails
And
the
liquor
in
our
cocktails
What
if
I
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental?
And
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
I
knew
I
wanted
your
body
I
laid
the
groundwork,
and
then
Just
like
clockwork
The
dominoes
cascaded
in
a
line
What
if
I
told
you
I
am
a
mastermind?
And
now
you
are
mine
It
was
all
my
design
'Cause
I
am
a
mastermind
No
one
wanted
to
play
with
me
as
a
little
kid
So
I
have
been
scheming
like
a
criminal
ever
since
To
make
them
love
me
and
make
it
seem
effortless
This
is
the
first
time
I
have
felt
the
need
to
confess
And
I
swear
I
am
only
cryptic
and
Machiavellian
'Cause
I
care
So
I
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental
And
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
Nothing
was
going
to
stop
me
I
laid
the
groundwork,
and
then
Saw
a
wide
smirk
on
your
face
You
knew
the
entire
time
You
knew
that
I
am
a
mastermind
And
now
you
are
mine
Yeah,
all
you
did
was
smile
'Cause
I
am
a
mastermind
