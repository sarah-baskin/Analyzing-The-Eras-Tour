once
upon
a
time
,
the
planets
and
the
fates
and
all
the
stars
aligned
you
and
i
ended
up
in
the
same
room
at
the
same
time
and
the
touch
of
a
hand
lit
the
fuse
of
a
chain
reaction
of
countermoves
to
assess
the
equation
of
you
checkmate
,
i
could
n't
lose
what
if
i
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental
?
and
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
nothing
was
gon
na
stop
me
i
laid
the
groundwork
,
and
then
just
like
clockwork
the
dominoes
cascaded
in
a
line
what
if
i
told
you
i
'm
a
mastermind
?
and
now
you
're
mine
it
was
all
by
design
'cause
i
'm
a
mastermind
you
see
,
all
the
wisest
women
had
to
do
it
this
way
'cause
we
were
born
to
be
the
pawn
in
every
lover
's
game
if
you
fail
to
plan
,
you
plan
to
fail
strategy
sets
the
scene
for
the
tale
i
'm
the
wind
in
our
free-flowing
sails
and
the
liquor
in
our
cocktails
what
if
i
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental
?
and
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
i
knew
i
wanted
your
body
i
laid
the
groundwork
,
and
then
just
like
clockwork
the
dominoes
cascaded
in
a
line
what
if
i
told
you
i
'm
a
mastermind
?
and
now
you
're
mine
it
was
all
my
design
'cause
i
'm
a
mastermind
no
one
wanted
to
play
with
me
as
a
little
kid
so
i
've
been
scheming
like
a
criminal
ever
since
to
make
them
love
me
and
make
it
seem
effortless
this
is
the
first
time
i
've
felt
the
need
to
confess
and
i
swear
i
'm
only
cryptic
and
machiavellian
'cause
i
care
so
i
told
you
none
of
it
was
accidental
and
the
first
night
that
you
saw
me
nothing
was
gon
na
stop
me
i
laid
the
groundwork
,
and
then
saw
a
wide
smirk
on
your
face
you
knew
the
entire
time
you
knew
that
i
'm
a
mastermind
and
now
you
're
mine
yeah
,
all
you
did
was
smile
'cause
i
'm
a
mastermind
