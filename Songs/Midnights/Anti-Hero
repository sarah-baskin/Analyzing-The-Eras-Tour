I
have
this
thing
where
I
get
older,
but
just
never
wiser
Midnights
become
my
afternoons
When
my
depression
works
the
graveyard
shift,
all
of
the
people
I
have
ghosted
stand
there
in
the
room
I
should
not
be
left
to
my
own
devices
They
come
with
prices
and
vices
I
end
up
in
crisis
(Tale
as
old
as
time)
I
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
One
day,
I
will
watch
as
you
are
leaving
'Cause
you
got
tired
of
my
scheming
(For
the
last
time)
It's
me,
hi
I
am
the
problem,
it
is
me
At
teatime,
everybody
agrees
I
will
stare
directly
at
the
sun,
but
never
in
the
mirror
It
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
Sometimes,
I
feel
like
everybody
is
a
sexy
baby
And
I
am
a
monster
on
the
hill
Too
big
to
hang
out,
slowly
lurching
toward
your
favorite
city
Pierced
through
the
heart,
but
never
killed
Did
you
hear
my
covert
narcissism
I
disguise
as
altruism
Like
some
kind
of
congressman?
(A
tale
as
old
as
time)
I
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
One
day,
I
will
watch
as
you
are
leaving
And
life
will
lose
all
its
meaning
(For
the
last
time)
It's
me,
hi
I
am
the
problem,
it
is
me
(I'm
the
problem,
it
is
me)
At
teatime,
everybody
agrees
I
will
stare
directly
at
the
sun,
but
never
in
the
mirror
It
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
I
have
this
dream
my
daughter-in-law
kills
me
for
the
money
She
thinks
I
left
them
in
the
will
The
family
gathers
'round
and
reads
it
and
then
someone
screams
out
"She's
laughing
up
at
us
from
Hell"
It's
me,
hi
I
am
the
problem,
it
is
me
It's
me,
hi
I
am
the
problem,
it
is
me
It's
me,
hi
Everybody
agrees,
everybody
agrees
It's
me,
hi
(Hi)
I
am
the
problem,
it
is
me
(I'm
the
problem,
it
is
me)
At
teatime
(Teatime),
everybody
agrees
(Everybody
agrees)
I
will
stare
directly
at
the
sun,
but
never
in
the
mirror
It
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
