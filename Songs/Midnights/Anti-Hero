i
have
this
thing
where
i
get
older
,
but
just
never
wiser
midnights
become
my
afternoons
when
my
depression
works
the
graveyard
shift
,
all
of
the
people
i
've
ghosted
stand
there
in
the
room
i
should
not
be
left
to
my
own
devices
they
come
with
prices
and
vices
i
end
up
in
crisis
(
tale
as
old
as
time
)
i
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
one
day
,
i
'll
watch
as
you
're
leaving
'cause
you
got
tired
of
my
scheming
(
for
the
last
time
)
it
's
me
,
hi
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
at
teatime
,
everybody
agrees
i
'll
stare
directly
at
the
sun
,
but
never
in
the
mirror
it
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
sometimes
,
i
feel
like
everybody
is
a
sexy
baby
and
i
'm
a
monster
on
the
hill
too
big
to
hang
out
,
slowly
lurching
toward
your
favorite
city
pierced
through
the
heart
,
but
never
killed
did
you
hear
my
covert
narcissism
i
disguise
as
altruism
like
some
kind
of
congressman
?
(
a
tale
as
old
as
time
)
i
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
one
day
,
i
'll
watch
as
you
're
leaving
and
life
will
lose
all
its
meaning
(
for
the
last
time
)
it
's
me
,
hi
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
(
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
)
at
teatime
,
everybody
agrees
i
'll
stare
directly
at
the
sun
,
but
never
in
the
mirror
it
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
i
have
this
dream
my
daughter-in-law
kills
me
for
the
money
she
thinks
i
left
them
in
the
will
the
family
gathers
'round
and
reads
it
and
then
someone
screams
out
``
she
's
laughing
up
at
us
from
hell
''
it
's
me
,
hi
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
it
's
me
,
hi
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
it
's
me
,
hi
everybody
agrees
,
everybody
agrees
it
's
me
,
hi
(
hi
)
i
'm
the
problem
,
it
's
me
(

)
at
teatime
