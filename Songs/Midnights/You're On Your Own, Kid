summer
went
away
,
still
,
the
yearning
stays
i
play
it
cool
with
the
best
of
them
i
wait
patiently
,
he
's
gon
na
notice
me
it
's
okay
,
we
're
the
best
of
friends
anyway
i
hear
it
in
your
voice
,
you
're
smoking
with
your
boys
i
touch
my
phone
as
if
it
's
your
face
i
did
n't
choose
this
town
,
i
dream
of
getting
out
there
's
just
one
who
could
make
me
stay
all
my
days
from
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
i
waited
ages
to
see
you
there
i
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
just
to
learn
that
you
never
cared
you
're
on
your
own
,
kid
you
always
have
been
i
see
the
great
escape
,
so
long
,
daisy
may
i
picked
the
petals
,
he
loves
me
not
something
different
bloomed
,
writing
in
my
room
i
play
my
songs
in
the
parking
lot
i
'll
run
away
from
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
i
called
a
taxi
to
take
me
there
i
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
just
to
learn
that
my
dreams
are
n't
rare
you
're
on
your
own
,
kid
you
always
have
been
from
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
i
gave
my
blood
,
sweat
,
and
tears
for
this
i
hosted
parties
and
starved
my
body
like
i
'd
be
saved
by
a
perfect
kiss
the
jokes
were
n't
funny
,
i
took
the
money
my
friends
from
home
do
n't
know
what
to
say
i
looked
around
in
a
blood-soaked
gown
and
i
saw
something
they
ca
n't
take
away
'cause
there
were
pages
turned
with
the
bridges
burned
everything
you
lose
is
a
step
you
take
so
,
make
the
friendship
bracelets
,
take
the
moment
and
taste
it
you
've
got
no
reason
to
be
afraid
you
're
on
your
own
,
kid
yeah
,
you
can
face
this
you
're
on
your
own
,
kid
you
always
have
been
