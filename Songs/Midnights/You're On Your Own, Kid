Summer
went
away,
still,
the
yearning
stays
I
play
it
cool
with
the
best
of
them
I
wait
patiently,
he
is
going
to
notice
me
It's
okay,
we
are
the
best
of
friends
Anyway
I
hear
it
in
your
voice,
you
are
smoking
with
your
boys
I
touch
my
phone
as
if
it
is
your
face
I
did
not
choose
this
town,
I
dream
of
getting
out
There's
just
one
who
could
make
me
stay
All
my
days
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
waited
ages
to
see
you
there
I
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
Just
to
learn
that
you
never
cared
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been
I
see
the
great
escape,
so
long,
Daisy
May
I
picked
the
petals,
he
loves
me
not
Something
different
bloomed,
writing
in
my
room
I
play
my
songs
in
the
parking
lot
I
will
run
away
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
called
a
taxi
to
take
me
there
I
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
Just
to
learn
that
my
dreams
are
not
rare
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
gave
my
blood,
sweat,
and
tears
for
this
I
hosted
parties
and
starved
my
body
Like
I
would
be
saved
by
a
perfect
kiss
The
jokes
were
not
funny,
I
took
the
money
My
friends
from
home
do
not
know
what
to
say
I
looked
around
in
a
blood-soaked
gown
And
I
saw
something
they
cannot
take
away
'Cause
there
were
pages
turned
with
the
bridges
burned
Everything
you
lose
is
a
step
you
take
So,
make
the
friendship
bracelets,
take
the
moment
and
taste
it
You've
got
no
reason
to
be
afraid
You're
on
your
own,
kid
Yeah,
you
can
face
this
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been
