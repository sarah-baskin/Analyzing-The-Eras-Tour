my
knuckles
were
bruised
like
violets
sucker
punching
walls
,
cursed
you
as
i
sleep-talked
spineless
in
my
tomb
of
silence
tore
your
banners
down
,
took
the
battle
underground
and
maybe
it
was
egos
swinging
maybe
it
was
her
flashes
of
the
battle
come
back
to
me
in
a
blur
all
that
bloodshed
,
crimson
clover
uh-huh
,
sweet
dream
was
over
my
hand
was
the
one
you
reached
for
all
throughout
the
great
war
always
remember
uh-huh
,
tears
on
the
letter
i
vowed
not
to
cry
anymore
if
we
survived
the
great
war
you
drew
up
some
good
faith
treaties
i
drew
curtains
closed
,
drank
my
poison
all
alone
you
said
i
have
to
trust
more
freely
but
diesel
is
desire
,
you
were
playing
with
fire
and
maybe
it
's
the
past
that
's
talking
screaming
from
the
crypt
telling
me
to
punish
you
for
things
you
never
did
so
i
justified
it
all
that
bloodshed
,
crimson
clover
uh-huh
,
the
bombs
were
closer
my
hand
was
the
one
you
reached
for
all
throughout
the
great
war
always
remember
uh-huh
,
the
burning
embers
i
vowed
not
to
fight
anymore
if
we
survived
the
great
war
uh-huh
,
uh-huh
it
turned
into
something
bigger
somewhere
in
the
haze
,
got
a
sense
i
'd
been
betrayed
your
finger
on
my
hairpin
triggers
soldier
down
on
that
icy
ground
looked
up
at
me
with
honor
and
truth
broken
and
blue
,
so
i
called
off
the
troops
that
was
the
night
i
nearly
lost
you
i
really
thought
i
'd
lost
you
we
can
plant
a
memory
garden
say
a
solemn
prayer
,
place
a
poppy
in
my
hair
there
's
no
morning
glory
,
it
was
war
,
it
was
n't
fair
and
we
will
never
go
back
to
that
bloodshed
,
crimson
clover
uh-huh
,
the
worst
was
over
my
hand
was
the
one
you
reached
for
all
throughout
the
great
war
always
remember
uh-huh
,
we
're
burned
for
better
i
vowed
i
would
always
be
yours
'cause
we
survived
the
great
war
uh-huh
,
uh-huh
i
will
always
be
yours
'cause
we
survived
the
great
war
uh-huh
i
vow
i
will
always
be
yours
