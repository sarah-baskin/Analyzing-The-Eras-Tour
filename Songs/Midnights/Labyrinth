"It
only
hurts
this
much
right
now"
Was
what
I
was
thinkin'
the
whole
time
Breathe
in,
breathe
through,
breathe
deep,
breathe
out
I
will
be
gettin'
over
you
my
whole
life
You
know
how
scared
I
am
of
elevators
Never
trust
it
if
it
rises
fast
It
cannot
last
Uh-oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
Oh
no,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
again
Oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
I
thought
the
plane
was
goin'
down
How'd
you
turn
it
right
around?
It
only
feels
this
raw
right
now
Lost
in
the
labyrinth
of
my
mind
Break
up,
break
free,
break
through,
break
down
You
would
break
your
back
to
make
me
break
a
smile
You
know
how
much
I
hate
That
everybody
just
expects
me
to
bounce
back
Just
like
that
Uh-oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
Oh
no,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
again
Oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
I
thought
the
plane
was
goin'
down
How'd
you
turn
it
right
around?
Uh-oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
Oh
no,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
again
Oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
I
thought
the
plane
was
goin'
down
How'd
you
turn
it
right
around?
Uh-oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
Oh
no,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
again
Oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
I
thought
the
plane
was
goin'
down
How'd
you
turn
it
right
around?
Uh-oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
Oh
no,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
again
Oh,
I
am
fallin'
in
love
I
thought
the
plane
was
goin'
down
How'd
you
turn
it
right
around?
