You
say,
"I
do
not
understand,"
and
I
say,
"I
know
you
don't"
We
thought
a
cure
would
come
through
in
time,
now,
I
fear
it
will
not
Remember
lookin'
at
this
room?
We
loved
it
because
of
the
light
Now,
I
just
sit
in
the
dark
and
wonder
if
it
is
time
Do
I
throw
out
everything
we
built
or
keep
it?
I
am
getting
tired
even
for
a
phoenix
Always
risin'
from
the
ashes
Mendin'
all
her
gashes
You
might
just
have
dealt
the
final
blow
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
I
cannot
find
a
pulse
My
heart
will
not
start
anymore
for
you
'Cause
you
are
losin'
me
Every
mornin',
I
glared
at
you
with
storms
in
my
eyes
How
can
you
say
that
you
love
someone
you
cannot
tell
is
dyin'?
I
sent
you
signals
and
bit
my
nails
down
to
the
quick
My
face
was
gray,
but
you
would
not
admit
that
we
were
sick
And
the
air
is
thick
with
loss
and
indecision
I
know
my
pain
is
such
an
imposition
Now,
you
are
runnin'
down
the
hallway
And
you
know
what
they
all
say
"You
do
not
know
what
you
got
until
it
is
gone"
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
Stop,
you
are
losin'
me
I
cannot
find
a
pulse
My
heart
will
not
start
anymore
for
you
'Cause
you
are
losin'
me
'Cause
you
are
losin'
me
Stop
(Stop)
because
you
are
losin'
me
My
heart
will
not
start
anymore
(Stop
because
you
are
losin'
me)
My
heart
will
not
start
anymore
(Stop
because
you
are
losin'
me)
How
long
could
we
be
a
sad
song
'Til
we
were
too
far
gone
to
bring
back
to
life?
I
gave
you
all
my
best
me's,
my
endless
empathy
And
all
I
did
was
bleed
as
I
tried
to
be
the
bravest
soldier
Fighting
in
only
your
army,
frontlines,
do
not
you
ignore
me
I
am
the
best
thing
at
this
party
(You're
losin'
me)
And
I
would
not
marry
me
either
A
pathological
people
pleaser
Who
only
wanted
you
to
see
her
And
I
am
fadin',
thinkin'
"Do
something,
babe,
say
something"
(Say
something)
"Lose
something,
babe,
risk
something"
(You're
losin'
me)
"Choose
something,
babe,
I
got
nothing"
(I
got
nothing)
"To
believe,
unless
you
are
choosin'
me"
You're
losin'
me
Stop
(Stop,
stop),
you
are
losin'
me
Stop
(Stop,
stop),
you
are
losin'
me
I
cannot
find
a
pulse
My
heart
will
not
start
anymore
