when
the
morning
came
we
were
cleaning
incense
off
your
vinyl
shelf
'cause
we
lost
track
of
time
again
laughing
with
my
feet
in
your
lap
like
you
were
my
closest
friend
``
how
'd
we
end
up
on
the
floor
,
anyway
?
''
you
say
``
your
roommate
's
cheap-ass
screw-top
ros√©
,
that
's
how
''
i
see
you
every
day
now
and
i
chose
you
the
one
i
was
dancing
with
in
new
york
,
no
shoes
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
it
was
the
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
and
how
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
so
scarlet
,
it
was
the
mark
they
saw
on
my
collarbone
the
rust
that
grew
between
telephones
the
lips
i
used
to
call
home
so
scarlet
,
it
was
maroon
when
the
silence
came
we
were
shaking
,
blind
and
hazy
how
the
hell
did
we
lose
sight
of
us
again
?
sobbing
with
your
head
in
your
hands
ai
n't
that
the
way
shit
always
ends
?
you
were
standing
hollow-eyed
in
the
hallway
carnations
you
had
thought
were
roses
,
that
's
us
i
feel
you
,
no
matter
what
the
rubies
that
i
gave
up
and
i
lost
you
the
one
i
was
dancing
with
in
new
york
,
no
shoes
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
it
was
(
maroon
)
the
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
and
how
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
so
scarlet
,
it
was
(
maroon
)
the
mark
they
saw
on
my
collarbone
the
rust
that
grew
between
telephones
the
lips
i
used
to
call
home
so
scarlet
,
it
was
maroon
and
i
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
that
's
a
real
fucking
legacy
,
legacy
(
it
was
maroon
)
and
i
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
that
's
a
real
fucking
legacy
to
leave
the
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
and
how
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
so
scarlet
,
it
