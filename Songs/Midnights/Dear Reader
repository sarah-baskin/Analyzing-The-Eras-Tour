dear
reader
,
if
it
feels
like
a
trap
you
're
already
in
one
dear
reader
,
get
out
your
map
pick
somewhere
and
just
run
dear
reader
,
burn
all
the
files
desert
all
your
past
lives
and
if
you
do
n't
recognize
yourself
that
means
you
did
it
right
never
take
advice
from
someone
who
's
falling
apart
never
take
advice
from
someone
who
's
falling
apart
(
you
should
find
another
)
dear
reader
,
bend
when
you
can
snap
when
you
have
to
dear
reader
,
you
do
n't
have
to
answer
just
'cause
they
asked
you
(
you
should
find
another
)
dear
reader
,
the
greatest
of
luxuries
is
your
secrets
dear
reader
,
when
you
aim
at
the
devil
make
sure
you
do
n't
miss
never
take
advice
from
someone
who
's
falling
apart
never
take
advice
from
someone
who
's
falling
apart
so
i
wander
through
these
nights
i
prefer
hiding
in
plain
sight
my
fourth
drink
in
my
hand
these
desperate
prayers
of
a
cursed
man
spilling
out
to
you
for
free
but
darling
,
darling
,
please
you
would
n't
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
knew
who
was
talking
if
you
knew
where
i
was
walking
to
a
house
,
not
a
home
,
all
alone
'cause
nobody
's
there
where
i
pace
in
my
pen
and
my
friends
found
friends
who
care
no
one
sees
when
you
lose
when
you
're
playing
solitaire
you
should
find
another
guiding
light
,
guiding
light
but
i
shine
so
bright
you
should
find
another
guiding
light
,
guiding
light
but
i
shine
so
bright
you
should
find
another
,
you
should
find
another
(
guiding
light
)
find
another
,
you
should
find
another
you
should
find
another
