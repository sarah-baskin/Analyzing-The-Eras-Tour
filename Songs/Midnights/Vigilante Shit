Draw
the
cat
eye
sharp
enough
to
kill
a
man
You
did
some
bad
things,
but
I
am
the
worst
of
them
Sometimes
I
wonder
which
one'll
be
your
last
lie
They
say
looks
can
kill
and
I
might
try
I
do
not
dress
for
women
I
do
not
dress
for
men
Lately,
I
have
been
dressin'
for
revenge
I
do
not
start
shit,
but
I
can
tell
you
how
it
ends
Don't
get
sad,
get
even
So
on
the
weekends
I
do
not
dress
for
friends
Lately,
I
have
been
dressin'
for
revenge
She
needed
cold,
hard
proof,
so
I
gave
her
some
She
had
the
envelope,
where
you
think
she
got
it
from?
Now
she
gets
the
house,
gets
the
kids,
gets
the
pride
Picture
me
thick
as
thieves
with
your
ex-wife
And
she
looks
so
pretty
Drivin'
in
your
Benz
Lately,
she
is
been
dressin'
for
revenge
She
do
not
start
shit,
but
she
can
tell
you
how
it
ends
Don't
get
sad,
get
even
So
on
the
weekends
She
do
not
dress
for
friends
Lately,
she
is
been
dressing
for
revenge
Ladies
always
rise
above
Ladies
know
what
people
want
Someone
sweet
and
kind
and
fun
The
lady
simply
had
enough
While
he
was
doin'
lines
and
crossin'
all
of
mine
Someone
told
his
white-collar
crimes
to
the
FBI
And
I
do
not
dress
for
villains
Or
for
innocents
I
am
on
my
vigilante
shit
again
I
do
not
start
shit,
but
I
can
tell
you
how
it
ends
Don't
get
sad,
get
even
So
on
the
weekends
I
do
not
dress
for
friends
Lately,
I
have
been
dressin'
for
revenge
