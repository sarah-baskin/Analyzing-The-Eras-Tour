one
thing
goin
'
on
i

that
it
was
somethin
'
'cause
i
do
n't
remember
who
i
was
before
you
painted
all
my
nights
a
color
i
've
searched
for
since
but
one
thing
after
another
fuckin
'
situations
,
circumstances
miscommunications
,
and
i
have
to
say
,
by
the
way
i
just
may
like
some
explanations
can
i
ask
you
a
question
?
did
you
ever
have
someone
kiss
you
in
a
crowded
room
and
every
single
one
of
your
friends
was
makin
'
fun
of
you
but
fifteen
seconds
later
,
they
were
clappin
'
too
?
then
what
did
you
do
?
did
you
leave
her
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
?
oh
did
you
wish
you
'd
put
up
more
of
a
fight
,
oh
when
she
said
it
was
too
much
?
do
you
wish
you
could
still
touch
her
?
it
's
just
a
question
half-moon
eyes
,
bad
surprise
did
you
realize
out
of
time
?
she
was
on
your
mind
with
some
dickhead
guy
that
you
saw
that
night
but
you
were
on
somethin
'
it
was
one
drink
after
another
fuckin
'
politics
and
gender
roles
and
you
're
not
sure
and
i
do
n't
know
got
swept
away
in
the
gray
i
just
may
like
to
have
a
conversation

i
ask
you
a
question
?
did
you
ever
have
someone
kiss
you
in
a
crowded
room
and
