We
could
leave
the
Christmas
lights
up
'til
January
And
this
is
our
place,
we
make
the
rules
And
there
is
a
dazzling
haze,
a
mysterious
way
about
you,
dear
Have
I
known
you
twenty
seconds
or
twenty
years?
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
You're
my,
my,
my,
my
lover
We
could
let
our
friends
crash
in
the
living
room
This
is
our
place,
we
make
the
call
And
I
am
highly
suspicious
that
everyone
who
sees
you
wants
you
I
have
loved
you
three
summers
now,
honey,
but
I
want
them
all
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
(Forever
and
ever)
You're
my,
my,
my,
my
lover
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
will
you
please
stand?
With
every
guitar
string
scar
on
my
hand
I
take
this
magnetic
force
of
a
man
to
be
my
lover
My
heart's
been
borrowed
and
yours
has
been
blue
All's
well
that
ends
well
to
end
up
with
you
Swear
to
be
overdramatic
and
true
to
my
lover
And
you
will
save
all
your
dirtiest
jokes
for
me
And
at
every
table,
I
will
save
you
a
seat,
lover
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
(Forever
and
ever)
You're
my,
my,
my,
my
Oh,
you
are
my,
my,
my,
my
Darling,
you
are
my,
my,
my,
my
lover
