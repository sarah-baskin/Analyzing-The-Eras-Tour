The
buttons
of
my
coat
were
tangled
in
my
hair
In
doctor's
office
lighting,
I
did
not
tell
you
I
was
scared
That
was
the
first
time
we
were
there
Holy
orange
bottles,
each
night,
I
pray
to
you
Desperate
people
find
faith,
so
now
I
pray
to
Jesus
too
And
I
say
to
you
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
You'll
get
better
soon
'Cause
you
have
to
I
know
delusion
when
I
see
it
in
the
mirror
You
like
the
nicer
nurses,
you
make
the
best
of
a
bad
deal
I
just
pretend
it
is
not
real
I
will
paint
the
kitchen
neon,
I
will
brighten
up
the
sky
I
know
I
will
never
get
it,
there
is
not
a
day
that
I
will
not
try
And
I
say
to
you
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
You'll
get
better
soon
'Cause
you
have
to
And
I
hate
to
make
this
all
about
me
But
who
am
I
supposed
to
talk
to?
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
If
there
is
no
you?
This
will
not
go
back
to
normal,
if
it
ever
was
It's
been
years
of
hoping
and
I
keep
saying
it
because
'Cause
I
have
to
Ooh-ah
You'll
get
better
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
You'll
get
better
soon
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
Soon,
you
will
get
better
Ooh-ah
You'll
get
better
soon
'Cause
you
have
to
