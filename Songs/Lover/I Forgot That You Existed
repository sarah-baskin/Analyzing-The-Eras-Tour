How
many
days
did
I
spend
thinking
'Bout
how
you
did
me
wrong,
wrong,
wrong?
Lived
in
the
shade
you
were
throwing
'Til
all
of
my
sunshine
was
gone,
gone,
gone
And
I
could
not
get
away
from
ya
In
my
feelings
more
than
Drake,
so
yeah
Your
name
on
my
lips,
tongue-tied
Free
rent,
living
in
my
mind
But
then
something
happened
one
magical
night
I
forgot
that
you
existed
And
I
thought
that
it
would
kill
me,
but
it
did
not
And
it
was
so
nice
So
peaceful
and
quiet
I
forgot
that
you
existed
It
is
not
love,
it
is
not
hate,
it
is
just
indifference
I
forgot
that
you
Got
out
some
popcorn
As
soon
as
my
rep
started
going
down,
down,
down
Laughed
on
the
school
yard
As
soon
as
I
tripped
up
and
hit
the
ground,
ground,
ground
And
I
would
have
stuck
around
for
ya
Would've
fought
the
whole
town,
so
yeah
Would've
been
right
there,
front
row
Even
if
nobody
came
to
your
show
But
you
showed
who
you
are,
then
one
magical
night
I
forgot
that
you
existed
And
I
thought
that
it
would
kill
me,
but
it
did
not
And
it
was
so
nice
So
peaceful
and
quiet
I
forgot
that
you
existed
It
is
not
love,
it
is
not
hate,
it
is
just
indifference
I
forgot
that
you
Sent
me
a
clear
message
Taught
me
some
hard
lessons
I
just
forget
what
they
were
It's
all
just
a
blur
I
forgot
that
you
existed
And
I
thought
that
it
would
kill
me,
but
it
did
not
And
it
was
so
nice
So
peaceful
and
quiet
I
forgot
that
you
existed
I
did,
I
did,
I
did
It
is
not
hate,
it
is
just
indifference
It
is
not
love,
it
is
not
hate,
it
is
just
indifference
So,
yeah
