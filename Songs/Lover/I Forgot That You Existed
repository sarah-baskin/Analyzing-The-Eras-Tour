how
many
days
did
i
spend
thinking
'bout
how
you
did
me
wrong
,
wrong
,
wrong
?
lived
in
the
shade
you
were
throwing
'til
all
of
my
sunshine
was
gone
,
gone
,
gone
and
i
could
n't
get
away
from
ya
in
my
feelings
more
than
drake
,
so
yeah
your
name
on
my
lips
,
tongue-tied
free
rent
,
living
in
my
mind
but
then
something
happened
one
magical
night
i
forgot
that
you
existed
and
i
thought
that
it
would
kill
me
,
but
it
did
n't
and
it
was
so
nice
so
peaceful
and
quiet
i
forgot
that
you
existed
it
is
n't
love
,
it
is
n't
hate
,
it
's
just
indifference
i
forgot
that
you
got
out
some
popcorn
as
soon
as
my
rep
started
going
down
,
down
,
down
laughed
on
the
school
yard
as
soon
as
i
tripped
up
and
hit
the
ground
,
ground
,
ground
and
i
would
've
stuck
around
for
ya
would
've
fought
the
whole
town
,
so
yeah
would
've
been
right
there
,
front
row
even
if
nobody
came
to
your
show
but
you
showed
who
you
are
,
then
one
magical
night
i
forgot
that
you
existed
and
i
thought
that
it
would
kill
me
,
but
it
did
n't
and
it
was
so
nice
so
peaceful
and
quiet
i
forgot
that
you
existed
it
is
n't
love
,
it
is
n't
hate
,
it
's
just
indifference
i
forgot
that
you
sent
me
a
clear
message
taught
me
some
hard
lessons
i
just
forget
what
they
were
it
's
all
just
a
blur
i
forgot
that
you
existed
and
i
thought
that
it
would
kill
me
,
but
it
did
n't
and
it
was
so
nice
so
peaceful
and
quiet
i
forgot
that
you
existed
i
did
,
i
did
,
i
did
it
is
n't
hate
,
it
's
just
indifference
it
is
n't
love
,
it
is
n't
hate
,
it
's
just
indifference
so
