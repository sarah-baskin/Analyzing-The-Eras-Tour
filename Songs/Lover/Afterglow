I
blew
things
out
of
proportion,
now
you
are
blue
Put
you
in
jail
for
something
you
did
not
do
I
pinned
your
hands
behind
your
back,
oh
Thought
I
had
reason
to
attack,
but
no
Fighting
with
a
true
love
is
boxing
with
no
gloves
Chemistry
'til
it
blows
up,
'til
there
is
no
us
Why'd
I
have
to
break
what
I
love
so
much?
It's
on
your
face,
and
I
am
to
blame,
I
need
to
say
Hey,
it
is
all
me,
in
my
head
I
am
the
one
who
burned
us
down
But
it
is
not
what
I
meant
Sorry
that
I
hurt
you
I
do
not
want
to
do,
I
do
not
want
to
do
this
to
you
(Ooh)
I
do
not
want
to
lose,
I
do
not
want
to
lose
this
with
you
(Ooh)
I
need
to
say,
hey,
it
is
all
me,
just
do
not
go
Meet
me
in
the
afterglow
It's
so
excruciating
to
see
you
low
Just
want
to
lift
you
up
and
not
let
you
go
This
ultraviolet
morning
light
below
Tells
me
this
love
is
worth
the
fight,
oh
I
lived
like
an
island,
punished
you
with
silence
Went
off
like
sirens,
just
crying
Why'd
I
have
to
break
what
I
love
so
much?
It's
on
your
face,
do
not
walk
away,
I
need
to
say
Hey,
it
is
all
me,
in
my
head
I
am
the
one
who
burned
us
down
But
it
is
not
what
I
meant
I
am
sorry
that
I
hurt
you
I
do
not
want
to
do,
I
do
not
want
to
do
this
to
you
(Ooh)
I
do
not
want
to
lose,
I
do
not
want
to
lose
this
with
you
(Ooh)
I
need
to
say,
hey,
it
is
all
me,
just
do
not
go
Meet
me
in
the
afterglow
Tell
me
that
you
are
still
mine
Tell
me
that
we
will
be
just
fine
Even
when
I
lose
my
mind
I
need
to
say
Tell
me
that
it
is
not
my
fault
Tell
me
that
I
am
all
you
want
Even
when
I
break
your
heart
I
need
to
say
Hey,
it
is
all
me,
in
my
head
I
am
the
one
who
burned
us
down
But
it
is
not
what
I
meant
Sorry
that
I
hurt
you
I
do
not
want
to
do,
I
do
not
want
to
do
this
to
you
(Ooh)
I
do
not
want
to
lose,
I
do
not
want
to
lose
this
with
you
(Ooh)
I
need
to
say,
hey,
it
is
all
me,
just
do
not
go
Meet
me
in
the
afterglow
