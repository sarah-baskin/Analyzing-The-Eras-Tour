I
think
he
knows
His
footprints
on
the
sidewalk
Lead
to
where
I
cannot
stop
Go
there
every
night
I
think
he
knows
His
hands
around
a
cold
glass
Make
me
want
to
know
that
Body
like
it
is
mine
He
got
that
boyish
look
that
I
like
in
a
man
I
am
an
architect,
I
am
drawing
up
the
plans
It's
like
I
am
17,
nobody
understands
No
one
understands
He
got
my
heartbeat
Skipping
down
16th
Avenue
Got
that,
ah,
I
mean
Wanna
see
what
is
under
that
attitude
like
I
want
you,
bless
my
soul
And
I
are
not
got
to
tell
him,
I
think
he
knows
I
think
he
knows
I
think
he
knows
When
we
get
all
alone
I
will
make
myself
at
home
And
he
will
want
me
to
stay
I
think
he
knows
He'd
better
lock
it
down
Or
I
will
not
stick
around
'Cause
good
ones
never
wait
(Ha)
He
got
that
boyish
look
that
I
like
in
a
man
I
am
an
architect,
I
am
drawing
up
the
plans
He's
so
obsessed
with
me
and,
boy,
I
understand
Boy,
I
understand
He
got
my
heartbeat
(Heartbeat)
Skipping
down
16th
Avenue
Got

Wanna

I
want
you,
bless
my
I
want
you,
bless
my
I
want
you,
bless
my
I
want
you,
bless
my
soul
Lyrical
smile,
indigo
eyes,
hand
on
my
thigh
We
could
follow
the
sparks,
I
will
drive
Lyrical
smile,
indigo
eyes,
hand
on
my
thigh
We
could
follow
the
sparks,
I
will
drive
"So
where
we
going
to
go?"
I
whisper
in
the
dark
"Where
we
going
to
go?"
I
think
he
knows
He
got
my
heartbeat
(Heartbeat)
Skipping
down
16th
Avenue
(Baby)
Got
that,
ah,
I
mean

mean)
Wanna
see
what

under
that
attitude
like
(Yeah)
I
want

got
my
heartbeat)
I

down
16th
Avenue,
baby)
I
want
