I
would
be
complex,
I
would
be
cool
They'd
say
I
played
the
field
before
I
found
someone
to
commit
to
And
that
would
be
okay
for
me
to
do
Every
conquest
I
had
made
would
make
me
more
of
a
boss
to
you
I
would
be
a
fearless
leader,
I
would
be
an
alpha
type
When
everyone
believes
ya,
what
is
that
like?
I
am
so
sick
of
running
as
fast
as
I
can
Wonderin'
if
I
would
get
there
quicker
if
I
was
a
man
And
I
am
so
sick
of
them
comin'
at
me
again
'Cause
if
I
was
a
man,
then
I
would
be
the
man
I
would
be
the
man
(Man)
I
would
be
the
man
(Man)
They'd
say
I
hustled,
put
in
the
work
They
would
not
shake
their
heads
and
question
how
much
of
this
I
deserve
What
I
was
wearing,
if
I
was
rude
Could
all
be
separated
from
my
good
ideas
and
power
moves
And
they
would
toast
to
me,
oh
(Ayy),
let
the
players
play
I
would
be
just
like
Leo
in
Saint-Tropez
I
am
so
sick
of
running
as
fast
as
I
can
Wonderin'
if
I
would
get
there
quicker
if
I
was
a
man
And
I
am
so
sick
of
them
comin'
at
me
again
'Cause
if
I
was
a
man,
then
I
would
be
the
man
I
would
be
the
man
(Man)
I
would
be
the
man
(Man)
What's
it
like
to
brag
about
raking
in
dollars
And
getting
bitches
and
models?
And
it
is
all
good
if
you
are
bad
And
it
is
okay
if
you
are
mad
If
I
was
out
flashin'
my
dollars
I
would
be
a
bitch,
not
a
baller
They'd
paint
me
out
to
be
bad
So
it
is
okay
that
I
am
mad
I
am
so
sick
of
running
as
fast
as
I
can
Wonderin'
if
I
would
get
there
quicker
if
I
was
a
man
(You
know
that)
And
I
am
so
sick
of
them
comin'
at
me
again
(Comin'
at
me
again)
'Cause
if
I
was
a
man
(If
I
was
a
man),
then
I
would
be
the
man
(Then
I
would
be
the
man)
I
am
so
sick
of
running
as
fast
as
I
can
(As
fast
as
I
can)
Wonderin'
if
I
would
get
there
quicker
if
I
was
a
man
(Hey)
And
I
am
so
sick
of
them
comin'
at
me
again
(Comin'
at
me
again)
'Cause
if
I
was
a
man
(If
I
was
a
man),
then
I
would
be
the
man
I
would
be
the
man
(Man)
I
would
be
the
man
(Man,
oh)
I
would
be
the
man
(Man,
yeah)
I
would
be
the
man
(Man,
I
would
be
the
man)
If
I
was
a
man
Then
I
would
be
the
man
