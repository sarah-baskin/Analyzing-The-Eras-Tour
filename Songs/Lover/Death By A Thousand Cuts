saying
goodbye
is
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
flashbacks
waking
me
up
i
get
drunk
,
but
it
's
not
enough
'cause
the
morning
comes
and
you
're
not
my
baby
i
look
through
the
windows
of
this
love
even
though
we
boarded
them
up
chandelier
's
still
flickering
here
'cause
i
ca
n't
pretend
it
's
okay
when
it
's
not
it
's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
i
dress
to
kill
my
time
,
i
take
the
long
way
home
i
ask
the
traffic
lights
if
it
'll
be
alright
they
say
,
``
i
do
n't
know
''
and
what
once
was
ours
is
no
one
's
now
i
see
you
everywhere
,
the
only
thing
we
share
is
this
small
town
you
said
it
was
a
great
love
,
one
for
the
ages
but
if
the
story
's
over
,
why
am
i
still
writing
pages
?
'cause
saying
goodbye
is
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
flashbacks
waking
me
up
i
get
drunk
,
but
it
's
not
enough

the
morning
comes

when
it
's
not
it
's
death
by
a
thousand

my
heart
,
my
hips
,
my
body
,
my
love
tryna
find
a
part
of
me
that
you
did
n't
touch
gave
up
on
me
like
i
was
a
bad
drug
now
i
'm
searching
for
signs
in
a
haunted
club
our
songs
,
our
films
,
united
we
stand
our
country
,
guess
it
was
a
lawless
land
quiet
my
fears
with
the
touch
of
your
hand
paper
cut
stings
from
our
paper-thin
plans
my
time
,
my
wine
,
my
spirit
,
my
trust
tryna
find
a
part
of
me
you
did
n't
take
up
gave
you
too
much
,
but
it
was
n't
enough
but
i
'll
be
alright
,
it
's
just
a
thousand
cuts
i
get
drunk
,
but
it
's
not
enough
'cause
you
're
not
my
baby
i
look
through
the

of

'cause
i
ca

's

when
it
's
not
no
,
it
's
not
it
's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
(
you
did
n't
touch
)
tryna
find
a
part
of
me
that
you
did
n't
touch
my
body
,
my
love
,
my
trust
(
it
's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
)
but
it
was
n't
enough
,
it
was
n't
enough
,
no
,
no
i
take
the
long
way
home
i
ask
the
traffic
lights
if
it
'll
be
alright
they
say
