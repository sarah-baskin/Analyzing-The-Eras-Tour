Saying
goodbye
is
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
Flashbacks
waking
me
up
I
get
drunk,
but
it
is
not
enough
'Cause
the
morning
comes
and
you
are
not
my
baby
I
look
through
the
windows
of
this
love
Even
though
we
boarded
them
up
Chandelier's
still
flickering
here
'Cause
I
cannot
pretend
it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
It's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
I
dress
to
kill
my
time,
I
take
the
long
way
home
I
ask
the
traffic
lights
if
it
will
be
alright
They
say,
"I
do
not
know"
And
what
once
was
ours
is
no
one's
now
I
see
you
everywhere,
the
only
thing
we
share
Is
this
small
town
You
said
it
was
a
great
love,
one
for
the
ages
But
if
the
story's
over,
why
am
I
still
writing
pages?
'Cause
saying
goodbye
is
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
Flashbacks
waking
me
up
I
get
drunk,
but
it
is
not
enough
'Cause
the
morning
comes
and
you
are
not
my
baby
I
look
through
the
windows
of
this
love
Even
though
we
boarded
them
up
Chandelier's
still
flickering
here
'Cause
I
cannot
pretend
it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
It's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
My
heart,
my
hips,
my
body,
my
love
Tryna
find
a
part
of
me
that
you
did
not
touch
Gave
up
on
me
like
I
was
a
bad
drug
Now
I
am
searching
for
signs
in
a
haunted
club
Our
songs,
our
films,
united
we
stand
Our
country,
guess
it
was
a
lawless
land
Quiet
my
fears
with
the
touch
of
your
hand
Paper
cut
stings
from
our
paper-thin
plans
My
time,
my
wine,
my
spirit,
my
trust
Tryna
find
a
part
of
me
you
did
not
take
up
Gave
you
too
much,
but
it
was
not
enough
But
I
will
be
alright,
it
is
just
a
thousand
cuts
I
get
drunk,
but
it
is
not
enough
'Cause
you
are
not
my
baby
I
look
through
the
windows
of
this
love
Even
though
we
boarded
them
up
Chandelier's
still
flickering
here
'Cause
I
cannot
pretend
it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
No,
it
is
not
It's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts
(You
did
not
touch)
Tryna
find
a
part
of
me
that
you
did
not
touch
My
body,
my
love,
my
trust
(It's
death
by
a
thousand
cuts)
But
it
was
not
enough,
it
was
not
enough,
no,
no
I
take
the
long
way
home
I
ask
the
traffic
lights
if
it
will
be
alright
They
say,
"I
do
not
know"
