wake
up
in
the
mornin
'
with

feelin
'
alone
a
heart
is
drawn
around
your
name
in
someone
's
handwriting
,
not
mine
sneakin
'
out
into
town
holdin
'
hands
,
just
killin
'
time
your
past
and
mine
are
parallel
lines
stars
all
aligned
and
they
intertwined
and
taught
you
the
way
you
call
me
``
baby
''
treat
me
like
a
lady
all
that
i
can
say
is
all
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
(

you
the
one
i
've
fallen
for
every
dead-end
street
led
you
straight
to
me
now
you

cryin
'
in

'
up
,
makin
'
up
