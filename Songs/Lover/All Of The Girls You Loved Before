When
you
think
of
all
the
late
nights
Lame
fights
over
the
phone
Wake
up
in
the
mornin'
with
someone
But
feelin'
alone
A
heart
is
drawn
around
your
name
In
someone
is
handwriting,
not
mine
Sneakin'
out
into
town
Holdin'
hands,
just
killin'
time
Your
past
and
mine
are
parallel
lines
Stars
all
aligned
and
they
intertwined
And
taught
you
The
way
you
call
me
"baby"
Treat
me
like
a
lady
All
that
I
can
say
is
All
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
(Ooh)
Made
you
the
one
I
have
fallen
for
Every
dead-end
street
led
you
straight
to
me
Now
you
are
all
I
need,
I
am
so
thankful
for
All
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
But
I
love
you
more
When
I
think
of
all
the
makeup
Fake
love
out
on
the
town
(Ooh)
Cryin'
in
the
bathroom
for
some
dude
Whose
name
I
cannot
remember
now
Secret
jokes
all
alone
No
one's
home,
sixteen
and
wild
(Ooh)
Breakin'
up,
makin'
up
Leave
without
sayin'
goodbye
(Ooh)
And
just
know
that
It's
everything
that
made
me
Now
I
call
you
"baby"
It's
why
you
are
so
amazing
All
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
(Ooh)
Made
you
the
one
I
have
fallen
for
Every
dead-end
street
led
you
straight
to
me
Now
you
are
all
I
need,
I
am
so
thankful
for
All
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
But
I
love
you
more
Your
mother
brought
you
up
loyal
and
kind
Teenage
love
taught
you
there
is
good
in
goodbye
Every
woman
that
you
knew
brought
you
here
I
want
to
teach
you
how
forever
feels
Like
the
girls
you
loved
before
(Ooh)
Made
you
the
one
I
have
fallen
for
Every
dead-end
street
(Dead-end
street)
led
you
straight
to
me
(Straight
to
me)
Now
you
are
all
I
need
(All
I
need),
I
am
so
thankful
for
All
of
the
girls
you
loved
before
But
I
love
you
more
(I
love
you
more)
(I
love
you
more)
