My
love
was
as
cruel
as
the
cities
I
lived
in
Everyone
looked
worse
in
the
light
There
are
so
many
lines
that
I
have
crossed
unforgiven
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
but
never
goodbye
I
do
not
want
to
look
at
anything
else
now
that
I
saw
you
I
do
not
want
to
think
of
anything
else
now
that
I
thought
of
you
I
have
been
sleepin'
so
long
in
a
twenty-year
dark
night
And
now
I
see
daylight,
I
only
see
daylight
Luck
of
the
draw
only
draws
the
unlucky
And
so
I
became
the
butt
of
the
joke
I
wounded
the
good
and
I
trusted
the
wicked
Clearin'
the
air,
I
breathed
in
the
smoke
Maybe
you
ran
with
the
wolves
and
refused
to
settle
down
Maybe
I
have
stormed
out
of
every
single
room
in
this
town
Threw
out
our
cloaks
and
our
daggers
because
it
is
morning
now
It's
brighter
now,
now
I
do
not
want
to
look
at
anything
else
now
that
I
saw
you
(I
can
never
look
away)
I
do
not
want
to
think
of
anything
else
now
that
I
thought
of
you
(Things
will
never
be
the
same)
I
have
been
sleepin'
so
long
in
a
twenty-year
dark
night
(Now
I
am
wide
awake)
And
now
I
see
daylight
(Daylight),
I
only
see
daylight
(Daylight)
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
And
I
can
still
see
it
all
(In
my
mind)
All
of
you,
all
of
me
(Intertwined)
I
once
believed
love
would
be
(Black
and
white)
But
it
is
golden
(Golden)
And
I
can
still
see
it
all
(In
my
head)
Back
and
forth
from
New
York
(Sneakin'
in
your
bed)
I
once
believed
love
would
be
(Burnin'
red)
But
it
is
golden
Like
daylight,
like
daylight
Like
daylight,
daylight
I
do
not
want
to
look
at
anything
else
now
that
I
saw
you
(I
can
never
look
away)
And
I
do
not
want
to
think
of
anything
else
now
that
I
thought
of
you
(Things
will
never
be
the
same)
I
have
been
sleepin'
so
long
in
a
twenty-year
dark
night
(Now
I
am
wide
awake)
And
now
I
see
daylight
(I
see
daylight),
I
only
see
daylight
(Ah)
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
(Ah)
(And
I
can
still
see
it
all)
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
(And
I
can
still
see
it
all,
back
and
forth
from
New
York)
I
only
see
daylight,
daylight,
daylight,
daylight
(I
once
believed
love
would
be
burning
red)
Like
daylight
It's
golden
like
daylight
You
got
to
step
into
the
daylight
and
let
it
go
Just
let
it
go,
let
it
go
I
want
to
be
defined
by
the
things
that
I
love
Not
the
things
I
hate
Not
the
things
I
am
afraid
of,
I
am
afraid
of
Or
the
things
that
haunt
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
I,
I
just
think
that
You
are
what
you
love
