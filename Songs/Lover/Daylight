my
love
was
as
cruel
as
the
cities
i
lived
in
everyone
looked
worse
in
the
light
there
are
so
many
lines
that
i
've
crossed
unforgiven
i
'll
tell
you
the
truth
but
never
goodbye
i
do
n't
wan
na
look
at
anything
else
now
that
i
saw
you
i
do
n't
wan
na
think
of
anything
else
now
that
i
thought
of
you
i
've
been
sleepin
'
so
long
in
a
twenty-year
dark
night
and
now
i
see
daylight
,
i
only
see
daylight
luck
of
the
draw
only
draws
the
unlucky
and
so
i
became
the
butt
of
the
joke
i
wounded
the
good
and
i
trusted
the
wicked
clearin
'
the
air
,
i
breathed
in
the
smoke
maybe
you
ran
with
the
wolves
and
refused
to
settle
down
maybe
i
've
stormed
out
of
every
single
room
in
this
town
threw
out
our
cloaks
and
our
daggers
because
it
's
morning
now
it
's
brighter
now
,
now
i
do
n't
wan
na
look
at
anything
else
now
that
i
saw
you
(
i
can
never
look
away
)
i
do
n't
wan
na
think
of
anything
else
now
that
i
thought
of
you
(
things
will
never
be
the
same
)
i
've
been
sleepin
'
so
long
in
a
twenty-year
dark
night
(
now
i
'm
wide
awake
)
and
now
i
see
daylight
(
daylight
)
,
i
only
see
daylight
(

all
(
in
my
mind
)
all
of
you
,
all
of
me
(
intertwined
)
i
once
believed
love
would
be
(
black
and
white
)
but
it
's
golden
(
golden
)
and
i
can
still
see
it
all
(
in
my
head
)
back
and
forth
from
new
york
(
sneakin
'
in
your
bed
)
i
once
believed
love
would
be
(
burnin
'
red
)
but
it
's
golden
like
