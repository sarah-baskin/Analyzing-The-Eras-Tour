The
moon
is
high
Like
your
friends
were
the
night
that
we
first
met
Went
home
and
tried
to
stalk
you
on
the
internet
Now
I
have
read
all
of
the
books
beside
your
bed
The
wine
is
cold
Like
the
shoulder
that
I
gave
you
in
the
street
Cat
and
mouse
for
a
month
or
two
or
three
Now
I
wake
up
in
the
night
and
watch
you
breathe
(Ayy)
Kiss
me
once
because
you
know
I
had
a
long
night
(Oh)
Kiss
me
twice
because
it
is
going
to
be
alright
(Uh)
Three
times
because
I
waited
my
whole
life
(One,
two,
one,
two,
three,
four)
I
like
shiny
things,
but
I
would
marry
you
with
paper
rings
Uh-huh,
that
is
right
Darling,
you
are
the
one
I
want,
and
I
hate
accidents,
except
when
we
went
from
friends
to
this
Uh-huh,
that
is
right
Darling,
you
are
the
one
I
want
In
paper
rings,
in
picture
frames,
in
dirty
dreams
Oh,
you
are
the
one
I
want
In
the
winter,
in
the
icy
outdoor
pool
When
you
jumped
in
first,
I
went
in
too
I
am
with
you
even
if
it
makes
me
blue
Which
takes
me
back
To
the
color
that
we
painted
your
brother's
wall
Honey,
without
all
the
exes,
fights
and
flaws
We
would
not
be
standing
here
so
tall,
so
(Ayy)
Kiss
you
once
because
I
know
you
had
a
long
night
(Oh)
Kiss
you
twice
because
it
is
going
to
be
alright
(Uh)
Three
times
because
you
waited
your
whole
life
(One,
two,
one,
two,
three,
four)
Ah
I
like
shiny
things,
but
I
would
marry
you
with
paper
rings
Uh-huh,
that
is
right
Darling,
you
are
the

I

and
I

In

rings,
in
picture
frames,
in
dirty
dreams
Oh,
you
are
the
one
I
want
I
want
to
drive
away
with
you
I
want
your
complications
too
I
want
your
dreary
Mondays
Wrap
your
arms
around
me,
baby
boy
I
want
to
drive
away
with
you
I
want
your
complications
too
I
want
your
dreary
Mondays
Wrap
your
arms
around

all
my
dreams
Oh,

You're
