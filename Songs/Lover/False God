how
i
'd
fly
to
you
?

i
ca
n't

new
york
city

still
do
it
for
you
,

all
warned
us
about
times
like
this
they
say
the
road
gets
hard
and
you
get
lost
when
you
're
led
by
blind
faith
,
blind
faith
but
we
might
just
get
away
with
it
religion
's
in
your
lips
even
if
it
's
a
false
god
we
'd
still
worship
we
might
just
get
away
with
it
the
altar
is
my
hips

it
's
a
false
god

'd
still
worship
this
love

fight
with
you
but

begging
for
forgiveness

wine
for
you
