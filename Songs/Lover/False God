We
were
crazy
to
think
Crazy
to
think
that
this
could
work
Remember
how
I
said
I
would
die
for
you?
We
were
stupid
to
jump
In
the
ocean
separating
us
Remember
how
I
would
fly
to
you?
And
I
cannot
talk
to
you
when
you
are
like
this
Staring
out
the
window
like
I
am
not
your
favorite
town
I
am
New
York
City
I
still
do
it
for
you,
babe
They
all
warned
us
about
times
like
this
They
say
the
road
gets
hard
and
you
get
lost
When
you
are
led
by
blind
faith,
blind
faith
But
we
might
just
get
away
with
it
Religion's
in
your
lips
Even
if
it
is
a
false
god
We'd
still
worship
We
might
just
get
away
with
it
The
altar
is
my
hips
Even
if
it
is
a
false
god
We'd
still
worship
this
love
We'd
still
worship
this
love
We'd
still
worship
this
love
I
know
heaven's
a
thing
I
go
there
when
you
touch
me,
honey
Hell
is
when
I
fight
with
you
But
we
can
patch
it
up
good
Make
confessions
and
we
are
begging
for
forgiveness
Got
the
wine
for
you
And
you
cannot
talk
to
me
when
I
am
like
this
Daring
you
to
leave
me
just
so
I
can
try
and
scare
you
You're
the
West
Village
You
still
do
it
for
me,
babe
They
all
warned
us
about
times
like
this
They
say
the
road
gets
hard
and
you
get
lost
When
you
are
led
by
blind

blind
faith
But
we
might
just
get
away
with
it
Religion's
in
your
lips
Even
if
it
is
a

god
We'd

We
might
just
get

with

The
altar
is
my
hips
Even
if
it
is
a
false
god
We'd
still
worship
this
love
We'd
still
worship
this
love
We'd
still
worship
this
love,
ah
Still
worship
this
love
Even
if
it
is
a
false
god
Even
if
it
is
a
false
god
Still
worship
this
love
