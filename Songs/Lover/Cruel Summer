their
eyes
what
does

kill
me
makes
me
want
you
more
and

feeling
i
've
got
and
it
's
ooh

's
a
cruel
summer

's
what
i
tell

rules
in
breakable
heaven
but
ooh
,
woah-oh
it
's
a
cruel
summer
with
you
hang
your
head
low
in
the
glow
of
the
vending
machine
i
'm
not
dying
(
oh
yeah
,
you
're
right
,
i
want
it
)

it
up
in
these
trying
times
we
're
not
trying
(

,
you
're
right
,
i
want
it
)

the
headlights
,

's
a
knife

'm
always
waiting
for
you
just
to
cut
to
the
bone
devils
roll
the
dice
,
angels
roll
their
eyes
and
if
i
bleed
,
you
'll
be
the
last
