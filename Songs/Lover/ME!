I
promise
that
you
will
never
find
another
like
me
I
know
that
I
am
a
handful,
baby,
uh
I
know
I
never
think
before
I
jump
And
you
are
the
kind
of
guy
the
ladies
want
(And
there
is
a
lotta
cool
chicks
out
there)
I
know
that
I
went
psycho
on
the
phone
I
never
leave
well
enough
alone
And
trouble's
going
to
follow
where
I
go
(And
there
is
a
lotta
cool
chicks
out
there)
But
one
of
these
things
is
not
like
the
others
Like
a
rainbow
with
all
of
the
colors
Baby
doll,
when
it
comes
to
a
lover
I
promise
that
you
will
never
find
another
like
Me-e-e,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I
am
the
only
one
of
me
Baby,
that
is
the
fun
of
me
Eeh-eeh-eeh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're
the
only
one
of
you
Baby,
that
is
the
fun
of
you
And
I
promise
that
nobody's
going
to
love
you
like
me-e-e
I
know
I
tend
to
make
it
about
me
I
know
you
never
get
just
what
you
see
But
I
will
never
bore
you,
baby
(And
there
is
a
lotta
lame
guys
out
there)
And
when
we
had
that
fight
out
in
the
rain
You
ran
after
me
and
called
my
name
I
never
want
to
see
you
walk
away
(And
there
is
a
lotta
lame
guys
out
there)
'Cause
one
of
these
things
is
not
like
the
others
Livin'
in
winter,
I
am
your
summer
Baby
doll,
when
it
