You
know
I
adore
you,
I
am
crazier
for
you
Than
I
was
at
sixteen,
lost
in
a
film
scene
Waving
homecoming
queens,
marching
band
playing
I
am
lost
in
the
lights
American
glory
faded
before
me
Now
I
am
feeling
hopeless,
ripped
up
my
prom
dress
Running
through
rose
thorns,
I
saw
the
scoreboard
And
ran
for
my
life
(Ah)
No
cameras
catch
my
pageant
smile
I
counted
days,
I
counted
miles
To
see
you
there,
to
see
you
there
It's
been
a
long
time
coming,
but
It's
you
and
me,
that
is
my
whole
world
They
whisper
in
the
hallway,
"She's
a
bad,
bad
girl"
(Okay)
The
whole
school
is
rolling
fake
dice
You
play
stupid
games,
you
win
stupid
prizes
It's
you
and
me,
there
is
nothing
like
this
Miss
Americana
and
The
Heartbreak
Prince
(Okay)
We're
so
sad,
we
paint
the
town
blue
Voted
most
likely
to
run
away
with
you
My
team
is
losing,
battered
and
bruising
I
see
the
high
fives
between
the
bad
guys
Leave
with
my
head
hung,
you
are
the
only
one
Who
seems
to
care
American
stories
burning
before
me
I
am
feeling
helpless,
the
damsels
are
depressed
Boys
will
be
boys
then,
where
are
the
wise
men?
Darling,
I
am
scared
(Ah)
No
cameras
catch
my
muffled
cries
I
counted
days,
I
counted
miles
To
see
you
there,
to
see
you
there
And
now
the
storm
is
coming,
but
It's
you
and
me,
that
is
my
whole
world
They
whisper
in
the
hallway,
"She's
a
bad,
bad
girl"

(Okay)
We're
so
sad,
we
paint
the
town
blue
Voted
most
likely
to
run
away
with
you
And
I
do
not
want
you
to
(Go),
I
do
not
really
want
to
(Fight)
'Cause
nobody's
going
to
(Win),
I
think
you
should
come
home
And
I
do
not
want
you
to
(Go),
I

I

'Cause
nobody's

just
thought
you
should
know
And
I
will
never
let
you
(Go)
because
I
know
this
is
a
(Fight)
That
someday
we
are
going
to
(Win)
It's
you
and
me,
that
is
my
whole
world
They
whisper
in
the
hallway,
"She's
a

Oh,
I
just
thought
you
should
know
(You
should
know)
It's
you
and
me,
there
is
nothing
like
this
(Like
