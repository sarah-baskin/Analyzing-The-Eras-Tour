you
know
i
adore
you
,
i
'm
crazier
for
you
than
i
was
at
sixteen
,
lost
in
a
film
scene
waving
homecoming
queens
,
marching
band
playing
i
'm
lost
in
the
lights
american
glory
faded
before
me
now
i
'm
feeling
hopeless
,
ripped
up
my
prom
dress
running
through
rose
thorns
,
i
saw
the
scoreboard
and
ran
for
my
life
(
ah
)
no
cameras
catch
my
pageant
smile
i
counted
days
,
i
counted
miles
to
see
you
there
,
to
see
you
there
it
's
been
a
long
time
coming
,
but
it
's
you
and
me
,
that
's
my
whole
world
they
whisper
in
the
hallway
,
``
she
's
a
bad
,
bad
girl
''
(
okay
)
the
whole
school
is
rolling
fake
dice
you
play
stupid
games
,
you
win
stupid
prizes
it
's
you
and
me
,
there
's
nothing
like
this
miss
americana
and
the
heartbreak
prince
(
okay
)
we
're
so
sad
,
we
paint
the
town
blue
voted
most
likely
to
run
away
with
you
my
team
is
losing
,
battered
and
bruising
i
see
the
high
fives
between
the
bad
guys
leave
with
my
head
hung
,
you
are
the
only
one
who
seems
to
care
american
stories
burning
before
me
i
'm
feeling
helpless
,
the
damsels
are
depressed
boys
will
be
boys
then
,
where
are
the
wise
men
?
darling
,
i
'm
scared
(
ah
)
no
cameras
catch
my
muffled
cries
i
counted
days
,
i
counted
miles
to
see
you
there
,
to
see
you
there
and
now
the
storm
is
coming
,
but
it
's
you
and
me
,
that
's
my
whole
world
