You
are
somebody
that
I
do
not
know
But
you
are
takin'
shots
at
me
like
it
is
Patr√≥n
And
I
am
just
like,
damn,
it
is
7
AM
Say
it
in
the
street,
that
is
a
knock-out
But
you
say
it
in
a
Tweet,
that
is
a
cop-out
And
I
am
just
like,
"Hey,
are
you
okay?"
And
I
are
not
tryna
mess
with
your
self-expression
But
I
have
learned
a
lesson
that
stressin'
and
obsessin'
'bout
somebody
else
is
no
fun
And
snakes
and
stones
never
broke
my
bones
So
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
You
need
to
calm
down,
you
are
being
too
loud
And
I
am
just
like
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
(Oh)
You
need
to
just
stop,
like
can
you
just
not
step
on
my
gown?
You
need
to
calm
down
You
are
somebody
that
we
do
not
know
But
you
are
comin'
at
my
friends
like
a
missile
Why
are
you
mad
when
you
could
be
GLAAD?
(You
could
be
GLAAD)
Sunshine
on
the
street
at
the
parade
But
you
would
rather
be
in
the
dark
ages
Makin'
that
sign
must
have
taken
all
night
You
just
need
to
take
several
seats
and
then
try
to
restore
the
peace
And
control
your
urges
to
scream
about
all
the
people
you
hate
'Cause
shade
never
made
anybody
less
gay
So
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
You
need
to
calm
down,
you
are
being
too
loud
And
I
am
just
like
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
(Oh)
You
need
to
just
stop,
like
can
you
just
not
step
on
his
gown?
You
need
to
calm
down
And
we
see
you
over
there
on
the
internet
Comparing
all
the
girls
who
are
killing
it
But
we
figured
you
out
We
all
know
now
we
all
got
crowns
You
need
to
calm
down
Oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
You
need
to
calm
down
(You
need
to
calm
down)
You're
being
too
loud
(You're
being
too
loud)
And
I
am
just
like
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh
(Oh)
You
need
to
just
stop
(Can
you
stop?)
Like
can
you
just
not
step
on
our
gowns?
You
need
to
calm
down
