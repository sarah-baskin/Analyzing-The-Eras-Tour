a
fresh
page
on
the
desk
filling
in
the
blanks
as
we
go
as
if
the
street
lights
pointed
in
an
arrow
head
leading
us
home
and
i
hope
i
never
lose
you
,
hope
it
never
ends
i
'd
never
walk
cornelia
street

's
the
kinda
heartbreak
time

never
mend
i
'd
never
walk
cornelia
street
again

i
get
mystified
by
