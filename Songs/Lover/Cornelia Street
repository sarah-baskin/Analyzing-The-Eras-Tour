We
were
in
the
backseat
Drunk
on
something
stronger
than
the
drinks
in
the
bar
"I
rent
a
place
on
Cornelia
Street"
I
say
casually
in
the
car
We
were
a
fresh
page
on
the
desk
Filling
in
the
blanks
as
we
go
As
if
the
street
lights
pointed
in
an
arrow
head
Leading
us
home
And
I
hope
I
never
lose
you,
hope
it
never
ends
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
That's
the
kind
of
heartbreak
time
could
never
mend
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
And
baby,
I
get
mystified
by
how
this
city
screams
your
name
And
baby,
I
am
so
terrified
of
if
you
ever
walk
away
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
Windows
flung
right
open,
autumn
air
Jacket
'round
my
shoulders
is
yours
We
bless
the
rains
on
Cornelia
Street
Memorize
the
creaks
in
the
floor
Back
when
we
were
card
sharks,
playing
games
I
thought
you
were
leading
me
on
I
packed
my
bags,
left
Cornelia
Street
Before
you
even
knew
I
was
gone
But
then
you
called,
showed
your
hand
I
turned
around
before
I
hit
the
tunnel
Sat
on
the
roof,
you
and
I
I
hope
I
never
lose
you,
hope
it
never
ends
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
That's
the
kind
of
heartbreak
time
could
never
mend
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
And
baby,
I
get
mystified
by
how
this
city
screams
your
name
(City
screams
your
name)
And
baby,
I
am
so
terrified
of
if
you
ever
walk
away
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
You
hold
my
hand
on
the
street
Walk
me
back
to
that
apartment
Years
ago,
we
were
just
inside
Barefoot
in
the
kitchen
Sacred
new
beginnings
That
became
my
religion,
listen
I
hope
I
never
lose
you
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
Oh,
never
again
And
baby,
I
get
mystified
by
how
this
city
screams
your
name
(City
screams
your
name)
And
baby,
I
am
so
terrified
of
if
you
ever
walk
away
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
I
do
not
want
to
lose
you
(Hope
it
never
ends)
I
would
never
walk
Cornelia
Street
again
I
do
not
want
to
lose
you
(Yeah)
"I
rent
a
place
on
Cornelia
Street"
I
say
casually
in
the
car
