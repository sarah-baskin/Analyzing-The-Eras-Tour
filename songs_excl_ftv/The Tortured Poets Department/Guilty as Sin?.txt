drownin
blue
nile
he
sent
me
downtown
lights
i
had
not
heard
it
my
boredom
bone-deep
cage
was
once
just
fine
am
i
allowed
cry
i
dream
crackin
locks
throwin
my
life
wolves
ocean
rocks
crashin
into
him
tonight
he
is
paradox
i
am
seeing
visions
am
i
bad
mad
wise
he
is
written
mine
my
upper
thigh
only
my
mind
one
slip
fallin
back
into
hedge
maze
way
die
i
keep
recalling
things
we
never
messy
top-lip
kiss
how
i
long
our
trysts
without
ever
touchin
his
skin
how
i
be
guilty
sin
i
keep
longings
locked
lowercase
inside
vault
someone
told
me
there
is
no
such
thing
bad
thoughts
only
your
actions
talk
fatal
fantasies
giving
way
labored
breath
takin
all
me
we
have
already
done
it
my
head
it
is
make-believe
it
feel
like
vow
we
will
both
uphold
somehow
he
is
written
mine
my
upper
thigh
only
my
mind
one
slip
fallin
back
into
hedge
maze
way
die
my
bed
sheets
are
ablaze
i
have
screamed
his
name
buildin
like
waves
crashin
over
my
grave
without
ever
touchin
his
skin
how
i
be
guilty
sin
i
roll
stone
away
they
are
going
crucify
me
anyway
way
you
hold
me
is
actually
is
holy
long-suffering
propriety
is
they
want
from
me
they
do
not
know
how
you
have
haunted
me
stunningly
i
choose
you
me
religiously
he
