throwin
my
life

written
mine
my
upper
thigh
my
mind
one
slip
fallin
back
hedge
maze
way
die
i
keep
recalling
thing
we
never
messy
top-lip
kiss
i
long
our
tryst
without
ever
touchin
his
skin
i
guilty
sin
i
keep
longing
locked
lowercase
inside
vault
someone
told
me

propriety
they
want
me
they

stunningly
i
choose
you
