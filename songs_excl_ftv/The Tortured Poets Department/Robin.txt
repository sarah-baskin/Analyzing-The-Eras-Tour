long
may
you
reign
you
are
animal
you
are
bloodthirsty
out
window
pane
talking
utter
nonsense
you
have
no
idea
string
tied
lever
slowed-down
clock
tethered
all
showmanship
keep
it
you
sweetness
way
go
tiger
higher
higher
wilder
lighter
you
long
may
you
roar
your
dinosaur
you
are
just
ruler
covered
mud
you
look
ridiculous
you
have
no
idea
buried
down
deep
out
your
reach
secret
we
all
vowed
keep
it
from
you
sweetness
way
go
tiger
higher
higher
wilder
lighter
you
you
got
dragonfly
above
your
bed
you
have
favorite
spot
swing
set
you
have
no
room
your
dream
regret
time
will
arrive
cruel
mean
you
will
learn
bounce
back
just
like
your
trampoline
we
will
curtail
your
curiosity
sweetness
way
go
tiger
