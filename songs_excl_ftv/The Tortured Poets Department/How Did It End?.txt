conduct
post-mortem
he
was
hot
house
flower
my
outdoorsman
our
maladies
were
such
we
could
not
cure
them
touch
was
my
birthright
became
foreign
come
one
come
all
it
is
happenin
again
empathetic
hunger
descends
we
will
tell
no
one
except
all
our
friends
we
must
know
how
it
end
we
were
blind
unforeseen
circumstances
we
learned
right
steps
different
dances
fell
victim
interlopers
glances
lost
game
chance
are
chances
soon
they
will
go
home
their
husbands
smug
because
they
know
they
trust
him
then
feverishly
calling
their
cousins
guess
we
ran
into
shops
walking
circles
like
she
was
lost
not
you
hear
they
called
it
all
off
one
gasp
then
how
it
end
say
it
once
again
with
feeling
how
death
rattle
breathing
silenced
soul
was
leaving
deflation
our
dreaming
leaving
me
bereft
reeling
my
beloved
ghost
me
sitting
tree

is
happenin
again

not
pretend
like
i
understand
how
it
end
come
one
come
all
it
is
happenin
again
empathetic
hunger
descends
we
will
tell
no
one
except
all
our
friends
i
