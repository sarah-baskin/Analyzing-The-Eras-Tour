smoke
cloud
billows
out
his
mouth
like
freight
train
through
small
town
jokes
he
told
across
bar
were
revolting
far
too
loud
they
shake
their
heads
sayin
god
help
her
when
i
tell
them
he
is
my
man
your
good
lord
not
need
lift
finger
i
fix
him
no
really
i
only
i
dopamine
races
through
his
brain
six-lane
texas
highway
his
hand
calloused
from
his
pistol
softly
traces
hearts
my
face
i
could
see
it
from
mile
away
perfect
case
my
certain
skill
set
he
had
halo
highest
grade
he
just
had
not
met
me
yet
they
shake
their
heads
sayin
god
help
her
when
i
tell
them
he
is
my
man
your
good
lord
not
need
lift
finger
i
fix
him
no
really
i
only
i
good
boy
is
right
come
close
i
will
show
you
heaven
you
will
be
angel
all
night
trust
me
i
handle
me
dangerous
man
no
really
i
they
shook
their
heads
sayin
god
help
her
when
i
told
them
he
is
my
man
your
good
lord
not
need
lift
finger
i
fix
him
no
really
i
maybe
i
not
