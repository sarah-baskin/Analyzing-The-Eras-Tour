is
going
stop
us
from
waltzing
back
into
rekindled
flames
we
know
steps
anyway
we
embroidered
memories
time
i
was
away
stitching
we
were
just
kids
babe
i
said
i
do
not
mind
it
takes
time
i
thought
i
was
better
safe
than
starry-eyed
i
felt
aglow
like
never
before
never
since
you
know
it
one
glimpse
it
is
legendary
you
i
go
from
one
kiss
getting
married
still
alive
killing
time
cemetery
never
quite
buried
your
suit
tie
nick
time
you
low-down
boy
you
stand-up
guy
you
holy
ghost
you
told
me
i
am
love
your
life
you
said
i
am
love
your
life
about
million
times
is
going
tell
me
truth
when
you
blew
with
winds
fate
told
me
i
reformed
you
when
your
impressionist
paintings
heaven
turned
out
be
fakes
well
you
took
me
hell
too
all
once
ink
bleeds
con
man
sells
fool
get-love-quick
scheme
i
have
felt
hole
like
never
before
ever
since
you
know
it
one
glimpse
it
is
legendary
we
thought
was
all
time
was
momentary
still
alive
killing
time
cemetery
never
quite
buried
you
cinephile
black
white
all
plot
twists
dynamite
mr.
steal
your
girl
then
make
her
cry
you
said
i
am
love
your
life
you
shit-talked
me
under
table
talkin
rings
talkin
cradles
i
wish
i
could
un-recall
how
we
almost
had
it
all
dancing
phantoms
terrace
are
they
second-hand
embarrassed
i
not
get
out
bed
because
something
counterfeit
dead
it
was
legendary
it
was
momentary
it
was
unnecessary
should
have
let
it
stay
buried
valiant
roar
bland
goodbye
coward
claimed
he
was
lion
i
am
combing
through
braids
lies
i
will
never
leave
never
mind
our
field
dreams
engulfed
fire
your
arson
match
your
somber
eyes
i
will
still
see
it
until
i
die
you
are
loss
my
life
