i
am
someone
until
recent
events
you
shared
your
secrets
with
your
location
you
forgot
turn
it
off
i
watch
you
walk
into
some
bar
called
black
dog
pierce
new
holes
my
heart
you
forgot
turn
it
off
it
hits
me
i
just
do
not
understand
how
you
do
not
miss
me
black
dog
when
someone
plays
starting
line
you
jump
she
is
too
young
know
song
was
intertwined
magic
fabric
our
dreaming
old
habits
die
screaming
i
move
through
world
with
heartbroken
my
longings
stay
unspoken
i
may
never
open
way
i
you
all
best
laid
plans
you
said
i
needed
brave
man
then
proceeded
play
him
until
i
believed
it
too
it
kills
me
i
just
do
not
understand
how
you
do
not
miss
me
shower
remember
how
my
rain-soaked
body
was
shakin
do
you
hate
me
was
it
hazing
cruel
fraternity
i
pledged
i
still
mean
it
old
habits
die
screaming
six
weeks
breathin
clean
air
i
still
miss
smoke
were
you
makin
fun
me
with
some
esoteric
joke
i
want
sell
my
house
set
fire
all
my
clothes
hire
priest
come
exorcise
my
demons
even
i
die
screaming
i
hope
you
hear
it
i
hope
it
is
shitty
black
dog
when
someone
plays
starting
line
you
jump
she
is
too
young
know
song
was
intertwined
tragic
fabric
our
dreaming
because
tail
between
your
legs
you
are
leavin
i
still
not
believe
it
because
old
habits
die
screaming
