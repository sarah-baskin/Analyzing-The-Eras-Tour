i
had
died
tiniest
death
i
spied
catch
your
breath
out
out
out
out
out
out
northbound
i
got
carried
away
you
boarded
your
train
south
south
south
south
south
south
feather
taken
wind
blowing
i
am
afflicted
not
knowing
i
look
people
windows
transfixed
rose
golden
glows
they
have
their
friends
over
drink
nice
wine
i
look
people
windows
case
you
are
their
table
your
eyes
looked
met
mine
one
more
time
you
had
stopped
tilted
your
head
i
still
ponder
it
meant
i
tried
searching
faces
streets
are
chances
you
would
be
downtown
downtown
downtown
it
feel
alright
not
know
me
i
am
addicted
only
i
look
people
windows
like
i
am
some
deranged
weirdo
i
attend
christmas
parties
from
outside
i
look
people
windows
case
you
are
their
table
your
eyes
looked
met
mine
one
more
time
