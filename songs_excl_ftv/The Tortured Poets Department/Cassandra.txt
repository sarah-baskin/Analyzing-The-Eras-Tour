i
was
my
new
house
placing
daydreams
patching
crack
along
wall
i
pass
it
lose
track
i
am
saying
because
is
i
was
when
i
got
call
when
first
stone
thrown
there
is
screamin
streets
there
is
raging
riot
when
it
is
burn
bitch
they
are
shrieking
when
truth
comes
out
it
is
quiet
they
killed
cassandra
first
because
she
feared
worst
tried
tell
town
they
filled
my
cell
with
snakes
i
regret
say
do
you
believe
me
i
was
my
tower
weaving
nightmares
twisting
all
my
smiles
into
snarls
they
say
not
kill
you
makes
you
aware
happens
it
becomes
you
are
they
killed
cassandra
first
because
she
feared
worst
tried
tell
town
they
set
my
life
flames
i
regret
say
do
you
believe
me
they
knew
they
knew
they
knew
whole
time
i
was
onto
somethin
family
pure
greed
christian
chorus
line
they
all
said
nothin
blood
thick
nothin
like
payroll
bet
they
never
spared
prayer
my
soul
you
mark
my
words
i
said
it
first
mourning
warning
no
one
heard
i
patched
crack
along
wall
i
pass
it
lose
track
i
am
saying
because
is
i
was
when
i
lost
it
