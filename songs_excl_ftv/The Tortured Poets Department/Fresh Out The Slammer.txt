my
first
call
will
be
another
summer
takin
cover
rolling
thunder
he
do
not
understand
me
splintered
back
winter
silent
dinners
bitter
he
was
with
her
dreams
gray
blue
fights
tunnels
handcuffed
spell
i
was
under
just
one
hour
sunshine
years
labor
locks
ceilings
shade
how
he
was
feeling
it
is
going
be
alright
i
my
time
pretty
baby
i
am
runnin
back
home
you
fresh
out
slammer
i
know
my
first
call
will
be
camera
flashes
welcome
bashes
get
matches
toss
ashes
off
ledge
i
said
my
letters
i
know
better
i
will
never
lose
my
baby
again
my
friends
tried
i
would
not
hear
it
watch
me
daily
disappearing
just
one
glimpse
his
smile
all
nights
he
kept
me
goin
swirled
you
into
all
my
poems
