different
scarlet
letters

is
just
classroom
because

threw
me
every
day
is
like
battle
every
night
with
us
is
like
dream
baby

are
new
romantics
come

along
with

heartbreak
is
national
anthem

sing
it
proudly
we
are
too
busy
dancin
get
knocked
off
our
feet
baby
we
are
new
romantics
best
people

hang
back
it
is
all
timing
it
is
poker

it
my
face
i
am
about
play
my
ace
we
need
love
all
we
want
is
danger

team
then
switch
sides
like
record
changer
rumors
are
terrible
cruel
honey
most
them
are
true
because
baby
i
could
build
castle
out
all
bricks

threw
me
every
day
is
like
