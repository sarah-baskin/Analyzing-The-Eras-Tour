worst
flowers
would
grown
together
died
thirst
months
months
back
forth
still
like
wine-stained
dress
wear
anymore
hung
head
lost
war
sky
turned
black
like
perfect
storm
rain
came
pouring
drownin
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
trace
think
finally
clean
nothin
left
butterflies
turned
dust
covered
whole
room
punched
hole
roof
let
flood
carry
away
pictures
water
filled
lungs
screamed
loud
one
heard
thing
rain
came
pourin
drownin
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
trace
think
finally
clean
think
finally
clean
said
think
finally
clean
ten
months
sober
must
admit
clean
mean
miss
ten
months
older
give
clean
never
going
risk
drought
worst
flowers
would
grown
together
died
