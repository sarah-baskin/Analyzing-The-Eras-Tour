turned
black
like
perfect
storm
rain
came
pouring
down
when

wa
drownin
is
when
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
wa
any
trace
you
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
there
wa
nothin
left
do
when
butterfly
turned
dust
covered
my
whole
room
i
punched
hole
roof
let
flood
carry
away
all
my
picture
you
water
filled
my
lung
i
screamed
loud
no
one
heard
thing

came
pourin
down
when
i
wa
drownin
is
when
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
