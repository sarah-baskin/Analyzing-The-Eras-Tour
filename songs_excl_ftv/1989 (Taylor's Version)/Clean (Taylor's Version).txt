my

i
lost
war
sky
turned
black
like
perfect
storm
rain
came
pouring
i
drownin
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
trace
you
i
think
i
finally
clean
nothin
left
butterfly
turned
dust
covered
my
whole
room
i
punched
hole
roof
let
flood
carry
away
my
picture
you
water
filled
my
lung
i
screamed
loud
one
heard
thing
rain
came
pourin
i
drownin
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
trace
you
i
think
i
finally
