drought
was
very
worst
when
flowers
we
would
grown
together
died
thirst
it
was
months
months
back
forth
you
are
still
all
over
me
like
wine-stained
dress
i
not
wear
anymore
hung
my
head
i
lost
war
sky
turned
black
like
perfect
storm
rain
came
pouring
down
when
i
was
drownin
is
when
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
was
any
trace
you
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
there
was
nothin
left
do
when
butterflies
turned
dust
covered
my
whole
room
i
punched
hole
roof
let
flood
carry
away
all
my
pictures
you
water
filled
my
lungs
i
screamed
loud
no
one
heard
thing
rain
came
pourin
down
when
i
was
drownin
is
when
i
could
finally
breathe
mornin
gone
was
any
trace
you
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
said
i
think
i
am
finally
clean
ten
months
sober
i
must
admit
just
because
you
are
clean
do
not
mean
you
do
not
miss
it
ten
months
older
i
will
not
give
i
am
clean
i
am
never
going
risk
it
