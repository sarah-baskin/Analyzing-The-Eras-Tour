one
look
dark
room
meant
just
you
time
moved
too
fast
you
play
it
back
buttons
coat
lighthearted
joke
no
proof
not
much
you
saw
enough
small
talk
he
drives
coffee
midnight
light
reflects
chain
your
neck
he
says
look
your
shoulders
brush
no
proof
one
touch
you
felt
enough
you
hear
it
silence
silence
you
you
feel
it
way
home
way
home
you
you
see
it
with
lights
out
lights
out
you
are
love
true
love
you
are
love
morning
his
place
burnt
toast
sunday
you
keep
his
shirt
he
keeps
his
word
once
you
let
go
your
fears
your
ghosts
one
step
not
much
it
said
enough
you
kiss
sidewalks
you
fight
then
you
talk
one
night
he
wakes
strange
look
his
face
pauses
then
says
you
are
my
best
friend
you
knew
it
was
he
is
love
you
hear
it
silence
silence
you
you
feel
it
way
home

home
you
you
see
it
with
lights
out

out
you
are
love
true
love
you
are
love
it
goes
you
two
are
dancing
snow
globe
'round

he
keeps
picture
you
his
office
downtown
you
understand
they
lost
their
minds
fought
wars
i
have
spent
my
whole
life
trying
put
it
into
words
because
you
hear
it
silence
you
feel
it
way
home
you
see
it
with
lights
out
you
are
love
true
