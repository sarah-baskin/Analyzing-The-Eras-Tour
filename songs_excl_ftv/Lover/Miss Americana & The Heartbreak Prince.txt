my
prom
dress
running
through
rose
thorns
i
saw
scoreboard
ran
my
life
no
cameras
catch
my
pageant
smile
i
counted
days
i
counted
miles
see
you
there
see
you
there
it

you

my
whole

whisper
hallway

girl
whole
school
is
rolling
fake
dice
you
play
stupid
games
you
win
stupid
prizes
it
is
you
me
there
is
nothing
like
miss
americana
heartbreak
prince
we
are
sad
we
paint
town
blue
voted
most
likely
run
away
with
you
my
team
is
losing
battered
bruising
i
see
high
fives
between
bad
guys
leave
with
my
head
hung
you
are
only
one
seems
care
american
stories
burning
before
me
i
am
feeling
helpless
damsels
are
depressed
boys
will
be
boys
then
are
wise
men
darling
i
am
scared
no
cameras
catch
my
muffled
cries
i
counted
days

counted
miles

you
there

is
coming
