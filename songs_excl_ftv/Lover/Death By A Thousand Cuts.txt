my
saying
goodbye
is
death
thousand
cuts
flashbacks
waking
me
i
get
drunk
it
is
not
enough
because
morning
comes
you
are
not
my
baby
i
look
through
windows
love
even
though
we
boarded
them
chandelier
still
flickering
here
because
i
not
pretend
it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
it
is
death
thousand
cuts
i
dress
kill
my
time
i
take
long
way
home
i
ask
traffic
lights
it
will
be
alright
they
say
i
do
not
know
once
was
ours
is
no
one
i
see
you
everywhere
only
thing
we
share
is
small
town
you
said
it
was
great
love
one
ages
story
over
am
i
still
writing
pages
because
saying
goodbye
is
death
thousand
cuts
flashbacks
waking
me
i
get
drunk
it
is
not
enough
because
morning
comes
you
are

it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
it
is
death
thousand
cuts
my
heart
my
hips
my
body
my
love
tryna
find
part
me
you
not
touch
gave
me
like
i
was
bad
drug
i
am
searching
signs
haunted
club
our
songs
our
films
united
we
stand
our
country
guess
it
was
lawless
land
quiet
my
fears
with
touch
your
hand
paper
cut
stings
from
our
paper-thin
plans
my
time
my
wine
my
spirit
my
trust
tryna
find
part
me
you
not
take
gave
you
too
much
it
was
not
enough
i
will
be
alright
it
is
just
thousand
cuts
i
get
drunk
it
is
not
enough
because
you
are
not
my
baby
i
look
through
windows
love
even
though
we
boarded
them
chandelier
still
flickering
here
because
i
not

it
is
okay
when
it
is
not
no
it
is
not
it
is
death
thousand
cuts
tryna
find
part
me
you
not
touch
my
body
my
love
my
trust
it
was
not
enough
it
was
not
enough
no
no
i
take
long
way
home
i
ask
traffic
lights
it
will
be
alright
they
say
i
do
not
know
