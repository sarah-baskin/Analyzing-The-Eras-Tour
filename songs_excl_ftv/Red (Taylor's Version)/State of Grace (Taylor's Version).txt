i
am
walkin
fast
through
traffic
light
busy
street
busy
life
all
we
know
is
touch
go
we
are
alone
with
our
changing
mind
we
fall
love
'til
it
hurt
bleeds
fade
time
i
never
saw
you
comin
i
will
never
be
same
you
come
around
armor
fall
pierce
room
like
cannonball
all
we
know
is
do
not
let
go
we
are
alone
just
you
me
your
room
our
slate
are
clean
just
twin
fire
sign
four
blue
eye
you
were
never
saint
i
loved
shade
wrong
we
learn
live
with
pain
mosaic
broken
heart
love
is
brave
wild
i
never
saw
you
comin
i
will
never
be
same
is
state
grace
is
worthwhile
fight
love
is
ruthless
game
unless
you
play
it
good
right
are
hand
fate
you
are
my
achilles
heel
is
golden
age
somethin
good
right
real
i
never
saw
you
comin
i
will
never
be
same
i
never
saw
you
comin
i
will
never
be
same
is
state
grace
is
worthwhile
fight
love
is
ruthless
game
unless
you
play
it
