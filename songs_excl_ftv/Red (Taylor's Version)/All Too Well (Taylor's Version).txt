i
walked
through
door
with
you
air
wa
cold
something
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
i
left
my
scarf
there
your
sister
house
you
have
still
got
it
your
drawer
even
your
sweet
disposition
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we
are
singing
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaf
falling
down
like
piece
into
place
i
picture
it
after
all
day
i
know
it
is
long
gone
magic
not
here
no
more
i
might
be
okay
i
am
not
fine
all
because
there
we
are
again
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
red
because
you
were
lookin
over
me
wind
my
hair
i
wa
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
photo
album
counter
your
cheek
were
turning
red
you
used
be
little
kid
with
glass
twin-sized
bed
your
mother
telling
story
'bout
you
tee-ball
team
you
taught
me
'bout
your
past
thinking
your
future
wa
me
i
know
it
is
long
gone
there
wa
nothing
else
i
could
do
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
forget
i
needed
because
there
we
are
again
middle
night
we
are
dancing
'round
kitchen
refrigerator
light
down
stair
i
wa
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
maybe
we
got
lost
translation
maybe
i
asked
too
much
maybe
thing
wa
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
all
running
scared
i
wa
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
you
call
me
again
just
break
me
like
promise
casually
cruel
name
being
honest
i
am
crumpled
piece
paper
lying
here
because
i
remember
it
all
all
all
too
well
time
will
not
fly
it
is
like
i
am
paralyzed
it
i
would
like
be
my
old
self
again
i
am
still
trying
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
day
night
when
you
made
me
your
own
you
mail
back
my
thing
i
walk
home
alone
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
very
first
week
because
it
reminds
you
innocence
it
smell
like
me
you
not
get
rid
it
because
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
because
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
back
before
you
lost
one
real
thing
you
have
ever
known
it
wa
rare
i
wa
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
wind
my
hair
you
were
there
you
remember
it
all
down
stair
you
were
there
you
remember
it
all
it
wa
rare
i
wa
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
