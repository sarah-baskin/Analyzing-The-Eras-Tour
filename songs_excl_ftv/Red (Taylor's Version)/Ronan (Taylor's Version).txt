i
remember
your
bare
foot
down
hallway
i
remember
your
little
laugh
race
car
kitchen
floor
plastic
dinosaur
i
love
you
moon
back
i
remember
your
blue
eye
lookin
into
mine
like
we
had
our
own
secret
club
i
remember
you
dancin
before
bedtime
then
jumpin
me
waking
me
i
still
feel
you
hold
my
hand
little
man
even
moment
i
knew
you
fought
it
hard
like
army
guy
remember
i
leaned
whispered
you
come
baby
with
me
we
are
going
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
year
i
remember
drive
home
when
blind
hope
turned
cryin
screamin
flower
pile
worst
way
no
one
know
say
about
beautiful
boy
died
it
is
about
be
halloween
you
could
be
anything
you
wanted
you
were
still
here
i
remember
last
day
when
i
kissed
your
face
whispered
your
ear
come
baby
with
me
we
are
going
fly
away
from
here
out
curtained
room
hospital
gray
we
will
just
disappear
come
baby
with
me
we
are
going
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
year
i
am
standin
your
closet
trying
talk
you
i
kept
hand-me-down
you
will
not
grow
into
i
really
thought
some
miracle
would
see
us
through
miracle
wa
even
gettin
one
moment
with
you
come
baby
with
me
we
are
going
fly
away
from
here
come
baby
with
me
we
are
going
fly
away
from
here
you
were
my
best
four
year
i
remember
your
bare
foot
down
hallway
i
love
you
moon
back
