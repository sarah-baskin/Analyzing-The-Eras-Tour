gleaming
twinkling
eye
like
sinking
ship
water
inviting
i
almost
jump
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
gold
rush
i
do
not
like
anticipatin
my
face
red
flush
i
do
not
like
anyone
would
die
feel
your
touch
everybody
want
you
everybody
wonder
it
would
be
like
love
you
walk
past
quick
brush
i
do
not
like
slow
motion
double
vision
rose
blush
i
do
not
like
falling
feel
like
flying
'til
bone
crush
everybody
want
you
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
must
it
be
like
grow
beautiful
with
your
hair
falling
into
place
like
domino
i
see
me
padding
across
your
wooden
floor
with
my
eagle
t-shirt
hanging
from
door
dinner
party
i
call
you
out
your
contrarian
shit
coastal
town
we
wandered
'round
had
never
seen
love
pure
it
then
it
fade
into
gray
my
day-old
tea
because
it
could
never
be
because
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
gold
rush
i
do
not

my

turn
your
life
into
folklore
i
not

dream
about
you
anymore
dinner

i
will
not
call
you
out
your
contrarian
shit
coastal
town
we
never

never
