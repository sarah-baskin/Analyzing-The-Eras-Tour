gleaming
twinkling
eyes
like
sinking
ships
waters
inviting
i
almost
jump
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
gold
rush
i
do
not
like
anticipatin
my
face
red
flush
i
do
not
like
anyone
would
die
feel
your
touch
everybody
wants
you
everybody
wonders
it
would
be
like
love
you
walk
past
quick
brush
i
do
not
like
slow
motion
double
vision
rose
blush
i
do
not
like
falling
feels
like
flying
'til
bone
crush
everybody
wants
you
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
must
it
be
like
grow
beautiful
with
your
hair
falling
into
place
like
dominoes
i
see
me
padding
across
your
wooden
floors
with
my
eagles
t-shirt
hanging
from
door
dinner
parties
i
call
you
out
your
contrarian
shit
coastal
town
we
wandered
'round
had
never
seen
love
pure
it
then
it
fades
into
gray
my
day-old
tea
because
it
could
never
be
because
i
do
not
like
gold
rush
gold
rush
i
do
not
like
anticipatin
my
face
red

my
mind
turns
your
life
into
folklore
i
not
dare
dream
about
you
anymore
dinner
parties
i
will
not
call
you
out
your
contrarian
shit
coastal
town
we
never
found
will
never

love
pure
