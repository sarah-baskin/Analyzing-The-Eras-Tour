are
right
here
i
not
relate
you
anymore

am
i
related
is
long
haul
how
we
get
here
soon
i
close
my
fist
around
something
delicate
i
shatter
you
i
am
sitting
bench
coney
island
wondering
my
baby
go
fast
times
bright
lights
merry
go
sorry
not
making
you
my
centerfold
over
over
lost
again
with
no
surprises
disappointments
close
your
eyes
it
gets
colder
colder
when
sun
goes
down
question
pounds
my
head
is
lifetime
achievement
i
pushed
you
edge
you
were
too
polite
leave
me
do
you
miss
rogue

you
into
paradise
left
you
there
will
you
forgive
my
soul
when
you
are
too
wise
trust
me
too
old
care
because
we
were
like
mall
before
internet

was
one
place
be
mischief
gift-wrapped
suburban
dreams
sorry
not
winning
you
arcade
ring
over
over
lost
again
with
no
surprises
disappointments
close
your
eyes
it
gets
colder

when
sun
goes
down
were
you
waiting
our
old
spot
tree
line
gold
clock
i
leave
you
hanging
every
single
day
were
you
standing
hallway
with
big
cake
happy
birthday
i
paint
your
bluest
skies
darkest
grey
universe
away
when
i
got
into
accident
sight
flashed
before
me
was
your
face
when
i
walked
podium
i
think
i
forgot
say
your
name
