capture
put
me
bad
light
i

my
footstep
each
stepping
stone
trying
find
one
i
went
wrong
writing
letter
addressed
fire
i
wa
catchin
my
breath
starin
out
open
window
catchin
my
death
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
be
evermore
december
guess
i
am
feeling
unmoored
not

i
used
fight
i
rewind
tape
all
it
is
pause
very
moment

wa
lost
sending
signal
be
double-crossed
i
wa
catchin
my
breath
barefoot
wildest
winter
catchin
my
death
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
be
evermore
not
not
think
all

certain
we
will
be
tall
again
whether
weather

frost
violence

me
through
i
swear
you
were
there
i
wa
catchin
my
breath

cabin
creakin
under
my
step
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
not
be
evermore

pain
would
not
be
evermore
