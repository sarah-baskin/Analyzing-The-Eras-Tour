gray
november
i
have
been
down
since
july
motion
capture
put
me
bad
light
i
replay
my
footsteps
each
stepping
stone
trying
find
one
i
went
wrong
writing
letters
addressed
fire
i
was
catchin
my
breath
starin
out
open
window
catchin
my
death
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
be
evermore
december
guess
i
am
feeling
unmoored
not
remember
i
used
fight
i
rewind
tape
all
it
is
pause
very
moment
all
was
lost
sending
signals
be
double-crossed
i
was
catchin
my
breath
barefoot
wildest
winter
catchin
my
death
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
be
evermore
not
not
think
all
cost
things
will
be
lost
we
just
get
pause
be
certain
we
will
be
tall
again
whether
weather
be
frost
violence
dog
days
i
am
waves
out
being
tossed
is
there
line
i
could
just
go
cross
when
i
was
shipwrecked
i
thought
you
cracks
light
i
dreamed
you
it
was
real
enough
get
me
through
i
swear
you
were
there
i
was
catchin
my
breath
floors
cabin
creakin
under
my
step
i
could
not
be
sure
i
had
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
not
be
evermore
evermore
evermore
pain
would
not
be
evermore
evermore
