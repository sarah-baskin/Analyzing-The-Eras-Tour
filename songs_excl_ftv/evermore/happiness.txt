yet
there
will
be
happiness
after
you
there
was
happiness
because
you
both
things
be
true
there
is
happiness
past
blood
bruise
past
curses
cries
beyond
terror
nightfall
haunted
look
my
eyes
would
have
loved
you
lifetime
leave
it
all
behind
there
is
happiness
tell
me
when
your
winning
smile
begin
look
like
smirk
when
all
our
lessons
start
look
like
weapons
pointed
my
deepest
hurt
i
hope
she
will
be
beautiful
fool
takes
my
spot
next
you

not
mean
sorry
i
not
see
facts
through
all
my
fury
you
have
not
met
new
me
yet
there
will
be
happiness
after
me
there
was
happiness
because

both
things
i
believe
there
is
happiness
our
history
across
our
great
divide
there
is
glorious
sunrise
dappled
with
flickers
light
from
dress
i
wore
midnight
leave
it
all
behind
there
is
happiness
i
not
make
it
go
away
making
you
villain

guess
it
is
price
i
paid
seven
years
heaven
i
pulled
your
body
into
mine
every
goddamn
night

get
fake
niceties
