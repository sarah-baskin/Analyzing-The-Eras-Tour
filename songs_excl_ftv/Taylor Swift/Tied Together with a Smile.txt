seems
only
one
not
see
your
beauty
is
face
mirror
looking
back
you
you
walk
around
here
thinking
you
are
not
pretty
is
not
true
because
i
know
you
hold
baby
you
are
losing
it
water
high
you
are
jumping
into
it
letting
go
no
one
know
you
cry
you
do
not
tell
anyone
you
might
not
be
golden
one
you
are
tied
together
with
smile
you
are
coming
undone
i
guess
it
is
true
love
wa
all
you
wanted
because
you
are
giving
it
away
like
it
is
extra
change
hoping
it
will
end
his
pocket
he
leaf
you
out
like
penny
rain
because
it
is
not
his
price
pay
it
is
not
his
price
pay
hold
baby
you
are
losing
it
water
high
you
are
jumping
into
it
letting

no

you
do
not
