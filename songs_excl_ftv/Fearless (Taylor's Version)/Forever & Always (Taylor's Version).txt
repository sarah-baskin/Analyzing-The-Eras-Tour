once
upon
time
i
believe
it
was
tuesday
when
i
caught
your
eye
we
caught
onto
somethin
i
hold
onto
night
you
looked
me
eye
told
me
you
loved
me
were
you
just
kiddin
because
it
seems
me
thing
is
breaking
down
we
almost
never
speak
i
do
not
feel
welcome
anymore
baby
happened
please
tell
me
because
one
second
it
was
perfect
you
are
halfway
out
door
i
stare
phone
he
still
has
not
called
then
you
feel
low
you
not
feel
nothin
all
you
flashback
when
he
said
forever
always
it
rains
your
bedroom
everythin
is
wrong
it
rains
when
you
are
here
it
rains
when
you
are
gone
because
i
was
there
when
you
said
forever
always
was
i
out
line
i
say
somethin
way
too
honest
made
you
run
hide
like
scared
little
boy
i
looked
into
your
eyes
thought
i
knew
you
minute
i
am
not
sure
here
is
everything
coming
down
nothin
here
is
silence
cuts
me
core
is
going
thought
i
knew
minute
i
do
not
anymore
i
stare
phone
he
still
has
not
called
then
you
feel
low
you
not
feel
nothin
all
you
flashback
when
he
said
forever
always
it
rains
your
bedroom
everythin
is
wrong
it
rains
when
you
are
here

when
you
are
