he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted
pain
he
wanted
bride
i
wa
making
my
own
name
chasing
fame
he
stayed
same
all
me
changed
like
midnight
my
town
wa
wasteland
full
cage
full
fence
pageant
queen
big
pretender
some
it
wa
paradise
my
boy
wa
montage
slow-motion
love
potion
jumping
off
thing
ocean
i
broke
his
heart
because
he
wa
nice
he
wa
sunshine
i
wa
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted
pain
he
wanted
bride
i
wa
making
my
own
name
chasing
fame
he
stayed
same
all
me
changed
like
midnight
it
came
like
postcard
picture
perfect
shiny
family
holiday
peppermint
candy
him
it
is
every
day
i
peered
through
window
deep
portal
time
travel
all
love
we
unravel
life
i
gave
away
because
he
wa
sunshine
i
wa
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted
pain
he
wanted
bride
i
wa
making
my

all
me
changed
like
midnight
i
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
just
we
wanted
just
we
wanted
he
never
think
me
except
when
i
am
tv
i
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
some
kind
haunted
some
kind
haunted
i
never
think
him
except
midnight
