he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted
pain
he
wanted
bride
i
making
my
name
chasing
fame
he
stayed
me
changed
like
midnight
my
town
wasteland
full
cage
full
fence
pageant
queen
big
pretender
it
paradise
my
boy
montage
slow-motion
love
potion
jumping
thing

i
broke
his
heart
he
nice
he
sunshine
i
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted
pain
he
wanted
bride
i
making
my
name
chasing
fame
he
stayed
me
changed
like
midnight

came
like

holiday
peppermint
candy
him
it
every
day
i
peered
window
deep
portal
time

he
sunshine
i
midnight
rain
he
wanted
it
comfortable
i
wanted

he
stayed
me
changed
like

wanted
he
never
think
me
except
i
