no
words
appear
before
me
aftermath
salt
streams
out
my
eyes
into
my
ears
every
single
thing
i
touch
becomes
sick
with
sadness
because
it
is
all
over
all
out
sea
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
you
were
bigger
than
whole
sky
you
were
more
than
just
short
time
i
have
got
lot
pine
about
i
have
got
lot
live
without
i
am
never
going
meet
could
have
been
would
have
been
should
have
been
you
could
have
been
would
have
been
you
some
bird
flap
its
wings
over
asia
some
force
take
you
because
i
not
pray
every
single
thing
come
has
turned
into
ashes
because
it
is
all
over
it
is
not
meant
be
i
will
say
words
i
do
not
believe
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
you
were
bigger
than
whole
sky
you
were
more
than
just
