summer
went
away
still
yearning
stays
i
play
it
cool
with
best
them
i
wait
patiently
he
is
going
notice
me
it
is
okay
we
are
best
friends
anyway
i
hear
it
your
voice
you
are
smoking
with
your
boys
i
touch
my
phone
it
is
your
face
i
not
choose
town
i
dream
getting
out
there
is
just
one
could
make
me
stay
all
my
days
from
sprinkler
splashes
fireplace
ashes
i
waited
ages
see
you
there
i
search
party
better
bodies
just
learn
you
never
cared
you
are
your
own
kid
you
always
have
been
i
see
great
escape
long
daisy
may
i
picked
petals
he
loves
me
not
something
different
bloomed
writing
my
room
i
play
my
songs
parking
lot
i
will
run
away
from
sprinkler
splashes
fireplace
ashes
i
called
taxi
take
me
there
i
search
party
better
bodies
just
learn
my
dreams
are
not
rare
you
are
your
own
kid
you
always
have
been
from
sprinkler
splashes
fireplace
ashes
i
gave
my
blood
sweat
tears
i
hosted
parties
starved
my
body
like
i
would
be
saved
perfect
kiss
jokes
were
not
funny
i
took
money
my
friends
from
home
do
not
know
say
i
looked
around
blood-soaked
gown
i
saw
something
they
not
take
away
because
there
were
pages
turned
with
bridges
burned
everything
you
lose
is
step
you
take
make
friendship
bracelets
take
moment
taste
it
you
have
got
no
reason
be
afraid
you
are
your
own
kid
yeah
you
face
you
are
your
own
kid
you
always
have
been
