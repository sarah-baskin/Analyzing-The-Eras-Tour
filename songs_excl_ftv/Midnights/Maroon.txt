when
morning
came
we
were
cleaning
incense
off
your
vinyl
shelf
because
we
lost
track
time
again
laughing
with
my
feet
your
lap
like
you
were
my
closest
friend
how
we
end
floor
anyway
you
say
your
roommate
cheap-ass
screw-top
ros√©
is
how
i
see
you
every
day
i
chose
you
one
i
was
dancing
with
new
york
no
shoes
looked
sky
it
was
burgundy
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
how
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
scarlet
it
was
mark
they
saw
my
collarbone
rust
grew
between
telephones
lips
i
used
call
home
scarlet
it
was
maroon
when
silence
came
we
were
shaking
blind
hazy
how
hell
we
lose
sight
us
again
sobbing
with
your
head
your
hands
are
not
way
shit
always
ends
you
were
standing
hollow-eyed
hallway
carnations
you
had
thought
were
roses
is
us
i
feel
you
no
matter
rubies
i
gave
i
lost
you
one
i
was
dancing
with
new
york
no
shoes
looked
sky
it
was
burgundy
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
how
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
scarlet
it
was
mark
they
saw
my
collarbone
rust
grew
between
telephones
lips
i
used
call
home
scarlet
it
was
maroon
i
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
is
real
fucking
legacy

i
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
