when
morning
came
we
were
cleaning
incense
off
your
vinyl
shelf
because
we
lost
track
time
again
laughing
with
my
foot
your
lap
like
you
were
my
closest
friend
how
we
end
floor
anyway
you
say
your
roommate
cheap-ass
screw-top
ros√©
is
how
i
see
you
every
day
i
chose
you
one
i
wa
dancing
with
new
york
no
shoe
looked
sky
it
wa
burgundy
my
t-shirt
when
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
how
blood
rushed
into
my
cheek
scarlet
it
wa
mark
they
saw
my
collarbone
rust
grew
between
telephone
lip
i
used
call
home
scarlet
it
wa
maroon
when
silence
came
we
were
shaking
blind
hazy
how
hell
we
lose
sight
us
again
sobbing
with
your
head
your
hand
are
not
way
shit
always
end
you
were
standing
hollow-eyed
hallway
carnation
you
had
thought
were

feel
you
no
matter

gave

lost
you
