my
knuckle
were
bruised
like
violet
sucker
punching
wall
cursed
you
i
sleep-talked
spineless
my
tomb
silence
tore
your
banner
down
took
battle
underground
maybe
it
wa
ego
swinging
maybe
it
wa
her
flash
battle
come
back
me
blur
all
bloodshed
crimson
clover
sweet
dream
wa
over
my
hand
wa
one
you
reached
all
throughout
great
war
always
remember
tear
letter
i
vowed
not
cry
anymore
we
survived
great
war
you
drew
some
good
faith
treaty
i
drew
curtain
closed
drank
my
poison
all
alone
you
said
i
have
trust
more
freely
diesel
is
desire
you
were
playing
with
fire
maybe
it
is
past
is
talking
screaming
from
crypt
telling
me
punish
you
thing
you
never
i
justified
it
all
bloodshed
crimson
clover
bomb
were
closer
my
hand
wa
one
you
reached
all
throughout
great
war
always
remember
burning
ember
i
vowed
not
fight
anymore
we
survived
great
war
it
turned
into
something
bigger
somewhere
haze
got
sense
i
would
been
betrayed
your
finger
my
hairpin
trigger
soldier
down
icy
ground
looked
me
with
honor
truth
broken
blue
i
called
off
troop
wa
night
i
nearly
lost
you
i
really
thought
i
would
lost
you

plant
memory
garden
say
solemn
prayer
place
poppy
my
hair
there
is
no
morning
glory

wa
not
fair

all
throughout
