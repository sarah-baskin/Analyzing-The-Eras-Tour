you
would
have
blinked
then
i
would
have
looked
away
first
glance
you
tasted
poison
you
could
have
spit
me
out
first
chance
i
was
some
paint
it
splatter
promising
grown
man
i
was
child
it
matter
you
got
wash
your
hands
all
i
used
do
was
pray
would
have

have
you
would
never
looked
my
way
i
would
have
stayed
my
knees
i
damn
sure
never
would
have
danced
with
devil
nineteen
god
honest
truth
is
pain
was
heaven
i
am
grown
i
am
scared
ghosts
memories
feel
like
weapons
i
know
i
wish
you
would
left
me
wondering
you
never
touched
me
i
would
have
gone
along
with
righteous
i
never
blushed
then
they
could
have
never
whispered
about
you
never
saved
me
from
boredom
i
could
have
gone
i
was
lord
you
made
me
feel
important
then
you
tried
erase
us
you
are
crisis
my
faith
would
have
could
have
should
have
i
would
only
played
it
safe
i
would
have
stayed
my
knees
i
damn

not
close
stained
glass
windows
my
mind

regret
you

time
