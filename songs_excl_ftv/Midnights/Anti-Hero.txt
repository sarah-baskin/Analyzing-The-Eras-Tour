i
have
thing

get
older
just
never
wiser
midnights
become
my
afternoons
when
my
depression
works
graveyard
shift
all
people
i
have
ghosted
stand
there
room
i
should
not
be
left
my
own
devices

come
with
prices
vices
i
end
crisis
i
wake
screaming
from
dreaming
one
day
i
will
watch
you
are
leaving
because
you
got
tired
my
scheming
it
is
me
hi
i
am
problem
it
is
me
teatime
everybody
agrees
i
will
stare
directly
sun
never
mirror
it
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
anti-hero
sometimes
i
feel
like
everybody
is
sexy
baby
i
am
monster
hill
too
big
hang
out
slowly
lurching
toward
your
favorite
city
pierced
through
heart
never
killed
you
hear
my
covert
narcissism
i
disguise
altruism
like
some
kind
congressman
i
wake
screaming
from
dreaming
one
day
i
will
watch
you
are
leaving
life
will
lose
all
its
meaning
it
is
me
hi
