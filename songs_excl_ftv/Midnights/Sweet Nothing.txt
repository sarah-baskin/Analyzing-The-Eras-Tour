i
spy
with
my
little
tired
eye
tiny
firefly
pebble
we
picked
last
july
down
deep
inside
your
pocket
we
almost
forgot
it
it
ever
miss
wicklow
sometimes
they
said
end
is
comin
everyone
is
somethin
i
find
myself
runnin
home
your
sweet
nothings
outside
they
are
push
shovin
you
are
kitchen
hummin
all
you
ever
wanted
from
me
was
sweet
nothin
way
home
i
wrote
poem
you
say
mind
happens
all
time
because
they
said
end
is
comin
everyone
is
somethin
i
find
myself
runnin
home
your
sweet
nothings
outside
they
are
push
shovin
you
are
kitchen
hummin
all
you
ever
wanted
from
me
was
nothin
industry
disruptors
soul
deconstructors
smooth-talking
hucksters
out
glad-handing
each
other
voices
implore
you
should
be
doing
more
you
i
admit
i
am
just
too
soft
all
it
they
said
end
is
comin
everyone
is
somethin
i
find
myself
runnin
home
your
sweet
nothings
outside
they
are
push
shovin
you
are

hummin
all
you
ever
wanted
from
