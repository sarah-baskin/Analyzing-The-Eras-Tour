elevator
buttons
morning
air
strangers
silence
makes
me
want
take
stairs
you
were
here
we
would
laugh
about
their
vacant
stares
right
my
time
is
theirs
seems
like
there
is
always
someone
disapproves
they
will
judge
it
like
they
know
about
me
you
verdict
comes
from
with
nothing
else
do
jury
out
my
choice
is
you
do
not
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
things
shine
life
makes
love
look
hard
stakes
are
high
water
rough
love
is
ours
you
never
know
people
have
their
sleeves
ghosts
from
your
past
going
jump
out
me
lurking
shadows
with
their
lip
gloss
smiles
i
do
not
care
because
right
you
are
mine
you
will
say
do
not
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
things
shine
life
makes
love
look
hard
stakes
are
high
water
rough
love
is
ours
it
is
not
theirs
speculate
it
is
wrong
your
hands
are
tough
they
are
mine
belong
i
will
fight
their
doubt
give
you
faith
with
song
you
because
i
love
gap
between
your
teeth
i
love
riddles
you
speak
any
snide
remarks
from
my
father
about
your
tattoos
will
be
ignored
because
my
heart
is
yours
do
not
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
things
shine
life
makes
love
look
hard
do
not
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
things
shine
they
not
take
is
ours
they
not
take
is
ours
stakes
are
high
water
rough
love
is
ours
