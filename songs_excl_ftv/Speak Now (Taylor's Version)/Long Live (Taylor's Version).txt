went
wild
we
were
kings
queens
they
read
off
our
names
night
you
danced
like
you
knew
our
lives
would
never
be
same
you
held
your
head
like
hero
history
book
page
it
was
end
decade
start
age
long
live
walls
we
crashed
through
how
kingdom
lights
shined
just
me
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
magic
we
made
bring
all
pretenders
one
day
we
will
be
remembered

feeling
i
pass
pictures
around
all
years
we
stood
there
sidelines
wishin
right

are
kings

you
traded
your
baseball
cap
crown
when
they
gave
us
our
trophies
we
held
them
our
town
cynics
were
outraged
screaming
is
absurd
because

we
crashed
through
how
kingdom
lights
shined
just

was
screaming
long
live
all
magic
we
made
bring
all
pretenders

not
afraid

live
all
mountains
we
moved
i
had
time
my
life
fighting

face
bring
all
pretenders
one
day
