there
i
was
again
tonight
forcing
laughter
faking
smiles
same
old
tired
lonely
place
walls
insincerity
shifting
eyes
vacancy
vanished
when
i
saw
your
face
all
i
say
is
it
was
enchanting
meet
you
your
eyes
whispered
have
we
met
across
room
your
silhouette
starts
make
its
way
me
playful
conversation
starts
counter
all
your
quick
remarks
like
passing
notes
secrecy
it
was
enchanting
meet
you
all
i
say
is
i
was
enchanted
meet
you
night
is
sparklin
do
not
you
let
it
go
i
am
wonderstruck
blushin
all
way
home
i
will
spend
forever
wonderin
you
knew
i
was
enchanted
meet
you
lingering
question
kept
me
2
a.m.
do
you
love
i
wonder
'til
i
am
wide
awake
i
am
pacing
back
forth
wishing
you
were
my
door
i
would
open
you
would
say
it
was
enchanting
meet
you
all
i
know
is
i
was
enchanted
meet
you
night
is
sparklin
do
not
you
let
it
go
