loved
me
you
go
away

i
do
recall
smell
rain
fresh
pavement
i
ran
off
plane
july
ninth
beat
your
heart
it
jumps
through
your
shirt
i
still
feel
your
arms
i
will
go
sit
floor
wearin
your
clothes
all
i
know
is
i
do
not
know
how
be
somethin

miss
i
never
thought
we
would
have
last
kiss
i
never
imagined

name
forever
name
my
lips
i
do
remember
swing
your
step
life
party

are
showin
off
again
i
would
roll
my
eyes
then
you
would
pull

i
because
i
love
your
handshake
meetin

with
your
hands
your
pockets
how
you
would
kiss
me
when
i
was

interruptions
