you
i
walk
fragile
line
i
have
known
it
all
time
i
never
thought
i
would
live
see
it
break
it
is
getting
dark
it
is
all
quiet
i
not
trust
anything
it
is
coming
over
you
like
it
is
all
big
mistake
holding
my
breath
will
not
lose
you
again
something
is
made
your
eyes
go
cold
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
something
is
gone
terribly
wrong
you
are
all
i
wanted
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
not
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
not
turn
back
i
am
haunted
stood
there
watched
you
walk
away
from
everything
we
had
i
still
mean
every
word
i
said
you
he
will
try
take
away
my
pain
he
just
might
make
me
smile
whole
time
i
am
wishing
he
was
you
instead
holding
my
breath
will
not
see
you
again
something
keeps
me
holding
onto
nothing
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
something
is
gone
terribly
wrong
you
are
all
i
wanted
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
not
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
not
turn
back
i
am
haunted
i
know
i
know
i
just
know
you
are
not
gone
you
not
be
gone
no
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
something
is
gone
terribly
wrong
will
not
finish
you
started
come
come
do
not
leave
me
like
i
thought
i
had
you
figured
out
not
breathe
whenever
you
are
gone
i
not
go
back
i
am
haunted
you
i
walk
fragile
line
i
have
known
it
all
time
never
ever
thought
i
would
see
it
break
never
thought
i
would
see
it
