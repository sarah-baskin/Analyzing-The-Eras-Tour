hour
'til
your
car
driveway
first
time
ever
hangin
you
tonight
i
got
my
money
thing
goin
badly

history
story
ending
sadly
still
hoping
fire
not
burn
me
one
time
one
time
i
know
could
either
break
my
heart
bring
it
back
life
got
feelin
your
electric
touch
could
fill
ghost
town
life
i
want
you
want
need
you
forever
heat
your
electric
touch
i
left
rain
lost
pining
i
tryin
hard
not
look
like
i
trying
every
time
i
tried
hard
love
it
fell
apart
i
gotten
used
one
callin
my
phone
i
grown
accustomed
sleepin
alone
still
i
know
it
take
get
it
right
one
time

time
i
know
could
either
break
my
heart
bring
it
back

along
you
decide
one
time
maybe
moment

two
headlight
i
know
could
either
break
my
heart
bring
it
back
life
got
feelin
your
electric
touch
i
know
could
either
break
my
heart
bring
it
back
life
got
feelin
your
electric
touch
could
fill
ghost
town
life
i
