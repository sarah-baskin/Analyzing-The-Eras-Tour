i
am
doing
good
i
am
some
new
shit
been
saying
yes
instead
no
i
thought
i
saw
you
bus
stop
i
not
though
i
hit
ground
running
each
night
i
hit
sunday
matinée
you
know
greatest
films
all
time
were
never
made
i
guess
you
never
know
never
know
you
wanted
me
you
really
should
have
showed
you
never
bleed
you
are
never
going
grow
it
is
alright
we
were
something
do
not
you
think
roaring
twenties
tossing
pennies
pool
my
wishes
came
true
it
would
have
been
you
my
defense
i
have
none
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
it
would
have
been
fun
you
would
have
been
one
i
have
dream
you
are
doing
cool
shit
having
adventures
your
own
you
meet
some
woman
internet
take
her
home
we
never
painted
numbers
baby
we
were
making
it
count
you
know
greatest
loves
all
time
are
over
i
guess
you
never
know
never
know
it
is
another
day
waking
alone
we
were
something
do
not
you
think
roaring
twenties
tossing
pennies
pool
my
wishes
came
true
it
would
have
been
you
my
defense
i
have
none
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
it
would
have
been
fun
you
would
have
been
one
i
i
i
persist
resist
temptation
ask
you
one
thing
had
been
different
would
everything
be
different
today
we
were
something
do
not
you
think
rosé
flowing
with
your
chosen
family
it
would
have
been
sweet
it
could
have
been
me
my
defense
i
have
none
digging
grave
another
time
it
would
have
been
fun
you
would
have
been
one
