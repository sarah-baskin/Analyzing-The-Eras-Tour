we
gather
here
we
line
weepin
sunlit
room
i
am
fire
you
will
be
made
ashes
too
even
my
worst
day
i
deserve
babe
all
hell
you
gave
me
because
i
loved
you
i
swear
i
loved
you
'til
my
dying
day
i
not
have
it
myself
go
with
grace
you
are
hero
flying
around
saving
face
i
am
dead
you
are
you
wake
cursing
my
name
wishing
i
stayed
look
how
my
tears
ricochet
we
gather
stones
never
knowing
they
will
mean
some
throw
some
make
diamond
ring
you
know
i
not
want
have
haunt
you
ghostly
scene
you
wear
same
jewels
i
gave
you
you
bury
me
i
not
have
it
myself
go
with
grace
because
when
i
would
fight
you
used
tell
me
i
was
brave
i
am
dead
you
are
you
wake
cursing
my
name
wishing
i
stayed
look
how
my
tears
ricochet
i
go
anywhere
i
want
anywhere
i
want
just
not
home
you
aim
my
heart
go
blood
you
would
still
miss
me
your
bones
i
still
talk
you
when
you
not
sleep
night
i
not
have
it
myself
go
with
grace
battleships
will
sink
beneath
waves
you
had
kill
me
it
killed
you
just
same
cursing
my
name
wishing
i
stayed
you
turned
into
your
worst
fears
you
are
tossing
out
blame
drunk
pain
crossing
out
good
years
you
are
cursing
my
name
wishing
i
stayed
look
how
my
tears
ricochet
