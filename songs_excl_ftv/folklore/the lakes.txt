is
it
romantic
how
all
my
elegies
eulogize
me
i
am
not
cut
out
all
cynical
clones
hunters
with
cell
phones
take
me
lakes
all
poets
went
die
i
do
not
belong
my
beloved
neither
do
you
windermere
peaks
look
like
perfect
place
cry
i
am
setting
off
not
without
my
muse
should
be
over
burrowed
under
my
skin
heart-stopping
waves
hurt
i
have
come
too
far
watch
some
namedropping
sleaze
tell
me
are
my
words
worth
take
me
lakes
all
poets
went
die
i
do
not
belong
my
beloved
neither
do
you
windermere
peaks
look
like
perfect
place
cry
i
am
setting
off
not
without
my
muse
i
want
auroras
sad
prose
i
want
watch
wisteria
grow
right
over
my
bare
feet
because
i
have
not
moved
years
i
want
you
right
here
red
rose
grew
out
ice
frozen
ground
with
no
one
around
tweet
it
i
bathe
cliffside
pools
with
my
calamitous
love
insurmountable
grief
take
me
lakes
all
poets
went
die
i
do
not
belong
my
beloved
neither
do
you
windermere
peaks
look
like
perfect
place
cry
i
am
setting
off
not
without
my
muse
no
not
without
you
