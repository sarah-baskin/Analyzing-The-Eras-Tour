come

is
clear

is
near

is
just
around
corner
darlin
because
it
lives

could
never
give
you
peace
i
am
fire
i
will
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
your
cascade
ocean
wave
blues
come
all
people
think
love
show
i
would
die
you
secret
devil
details

friend
me
would
it
be
enough
i
could
never
give
you
peace
your
integrity
makes
me
seem
small
you
paint
dreamscapes
wall
i
talk
shit
with
my
friends
it
is
like
i
am
wasting
your
honor

swing
with
you
fences

with
you
trenches
give
you
my
wild
give
you
child

comes
when
two
people
understand
each
other
family
