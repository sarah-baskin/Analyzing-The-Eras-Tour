i
walked
door
you
air
cold
something
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
i
left
my
scarf
your
sister
house
you
still
got
it
your
drawer
even
your
sweet
disposition
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we
singing
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaf
falling
like
piece
place
i
picture
it
day
i
know
it
long
gone
magic
not
i
might
okay
i
not
fine
we
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
red
you
lookin
me
wind
my
hair
i
i
remember
it
well
photo
album
counter
your
cheek
turning
red
you
used
little
kid
glass
twin-sized
bed
your
mother
telling
story
'bout
you
tee-ball
team
you
taught
me
'bout
your
past
thinking
your
future
me
i
know
it
long
gone
nothing
else
i
could
i
forget
you
long
enough
forget
i
needed
we
middle
night
we
dancing
'round
kitchen
refrigerator
light
stair
i
i
remember
it
well
yeah
maybe
we
got
lost
translation
maybe
i
asked
much
maybe
thing
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
running
scared
i
i
remember
it
well
you
call
me
break
me
like
promise
casually
cruel
name
honest
i
crumpled
piece
paper
lying
i
remember
it
well
time
not
fly
it
like
i
paralyzed
it
i
would
like
my
old
self
i
still
trying
find
it
plaid
shirt
day
night

made
me
your
you
mail
back
my
thing
i
walk
home
alone
you
keep
my
old
scarf
first
week

reminds
you
innocence
it
smell
like
me
you
not
get
rid
it
you
remember
it
well
yeah
we
i
loved
you
back
you
lost
one
real
thing

ever
known
it

remember
it
well

my
hair

you
remember
it
stair

it
well
