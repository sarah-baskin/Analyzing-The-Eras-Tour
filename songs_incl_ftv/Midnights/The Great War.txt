my
knuckle
bruised
like
violet
sucker
punching
wall
cursed
you
i
sleep-talked
spineless
my
tomb
silence
tore
your
banner
took
battle
underground
maybe
it
ego
swinging
maybe
it
her
flash
battle
come
back
me
blur
bloodshed
crimson
clover
sweet
dream
my
hand
one
you
reached
throughout
great
war
always
remember
tear
letter
i
vowed
not
cry
anymore
we
survived
great
war
you
drew
good
faith
treaty
i
drew
curtain
closed
drank
my
poison
alone
you
said
i
trust
freely
diesel
desire
you
playing
fire
maybe
it
past
talking
screaming
crypt
telling
me
punish
you
thing
you
never
i
justified
it
bloodshed
crimson
clover
bomb
closer
my
hand
one
you
reached
throughout
great
war
always
remember
burning
ember
i
vowed
not
fight
anymore
we
survived
great
war
it
turned
something
bigger
somewhere
haze
got
sense
i
would
betrayed
your
finger
my
hairpin
trigger
soldier
icy
ground
looked
me
honor
truth
broken
blue
i
called
troop
night
i
nearly
lost
you
i
really
thought
i
would
lost
you
we
plant
memory
garden
say
solemn
prayer
place
poppy
my
hair
morning
glory
it
war
it
not
fair
we
never
go
back
bloodshed
crimson
clover
worst
my
hand
one
you
reached
throughout
great
war
always
remember
we
burned
better
i
vowed
i
would
always
yours
we
survived
great
war
i
always
yours
we
survived
great
war
i
vow
i
always
yours
