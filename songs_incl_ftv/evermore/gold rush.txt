gold
rush
i
not
like
anticipatin
my
face
red
flush
i
not

feel
your
touch
everybody
want
you
everybody
wonder
it
would
like
love
you
walk
past
quick
brush
i
not
like
slow
motion
double
vision
rose
blush
i
not
like
falling
feel
like
flying
'til
bone
crush
everybody
want
you
i
not
like
gold
rush
must
it
like
grow
beautiful
your
hair
falling
place
like
domino
i
see
me
padding
across
your
wooden
floor
my
eagle
t-shirt
hanging
door
dinner
party
i
call
you
your
contrarian
shit
coastal
town
we
wandered
'round
never
seen
love
pure
it
it
fade
gray
my
day-old
tea
it
could
never
i
not
like
gold
rush
