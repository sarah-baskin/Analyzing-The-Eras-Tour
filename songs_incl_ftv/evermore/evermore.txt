trying

fire
i
catchin
my

i
feeling
peculiar
pain

evermore
december
guess
i
feeling
unmoored
not

i
used
fight
i
rewind
tape
it
pause
moment
lost
sending
signal
double-crossed
i
catchin
my
breath
barefoot
wildest
winter
catchin
my
death
i
could
not
sure
i
feeling
peculiar
pain
would
evermore
not

certain

shipwrecked
i
thought
you
crack
light
i
dreamed
you
it
real

catchin
my
