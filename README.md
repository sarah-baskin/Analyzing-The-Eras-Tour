Updated: 12.11.2024

## Introduction and Project Motivation

With Taylor Swift seemingly on top of mind wherever we turn (whether it's from news of her ongoing, incredibly successful international tour, images of her and Travis Kelce circling online, or her astoundingly amazing album sales), it's clear that she has had a profound impact on the popular culture of today.
Incidental to this is the increasingly relevancy of the distinct 'eras' in her music.
